<h2 id="article-1">1. Adherence to health-related fitness tests in working-aged adults-who are we (not) measuring?</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: Clinical physiology and functional imaging
<strong>发表日期</strong>: 2025-Sep
<strong>链接</strong>: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40753493">PubMed</a></p>

<h3 id="摘要">摘要</h3>
<p>This study aimed to examine the adherence to selected health-related fitness (HRF) tests in adults. In addition, we investigated how excluded participants or those who did not attend HRF tests differed in their background characteristics from those who attended.
Two population study samples comprising 3867 (1594 males) 20─69-year-old participants performing HRF tests, or 1249 (456 males) participants answering only the study questionnaire, were pooled for the analyses. The selected HRF tests were: one-leg stand, neck-shoulder mobility, jump-and-reach, modified push-ups, and 6-min walking test. The exclusion rate was analyzed separately for each test.
In total, 14.9% of the participants were excluded from at least one test. Failure to meet the health criteria and unwillingness to perform the test were the most typical reasons for the exclusion. The exclusion rate was highest in the modified push-up test (13.2%), while in all other tests, the rate was less than 5%. Excluded participants were more likely (p &lt; 0.001) older (46-69 years) (OR = 4.59), not meeting physical activity recommendations for endurance (OR = 2.28) and perceiving their health (OR = 3.69) and fitness (OR = 3.26) as poor. Similarly, participants who answered only the questionnaire were more likely (p &lt; 0.01) to perceive their health (OR = 1.56) and fitness (OR = 1.41) as poor and not meeting physical activity recommendations for endurance (OR = 1.48).
The assessed HRF tests were feasible in terms of low exclusion rates. Individuals that were excluded or not participating the tests differed in their background characteristics from those who attended highlighting the importance of feasible testing methods to achieve a representative population sample of participants.</p>

<h2 id="article-2">2. Administrative Harm.</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: The Medical clinics of North America
<strong>发表日期</strong>: 2025-Sep
<strong>链接</strong>: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40752935">PubMed</a></p>

<h3 id="摘要-1">摘要</h3>
<p>Administrative harm (AH) refers to the adverse consequences of administrative decisions in health care and directly influences patient care, workforce, and organizational outcomes. It is pervasive and comes from all organizational decision-makers, including formal and informal leaders. Organizations often lack mechanisms for identification, measurement, and feedback related to AH. Proposed solutions include developing a definition and understanding of AH, collaborative cultures and psychological safety, structures and processes to support optimal decision-making, measurement and data strategies for AH, and reporting and learning systems. These approaches aim to mitigate administrative harm and improve health care delivery and outcomes.</p>

<h2 id="article-4">4. Comparative insights into mild cognitive impairment: A clinical case study with 18F-FDG and amyloid PET imaging.</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: Hellenic journal of nuclear medicine
<strong>发表日期</strong>: 2025-Aug-04

<h3 id="摘要-3">摘要</h3>
<p>Early detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is crucial for initiating therapeutic interventions that may slow or prevent further cognitive deterioration. Mild cognitive impairment represents a transitional phase between normal cognitive aging and more severe forms of dementia, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Positron emission tomography (PET) can provide insight into the pathophysiology and progression of neurodegenerative processes associated with dementia and MCI using either fluorine-18 (18F)-florbetapir, which detects beta-amyloid plaque burden, or 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG), which measures glucose metabolism. However, there are limited comparative studies using the two radiotracers to quantify cognitive decline. This case study presents an 83-year-old female with a clinical diagnosis of MCI and a mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score of 26, at the lower boundary for normal cognitive function; she was assessed with PET/computed tomography (CT) using both radiotracers. Although global assessments did not reveal significant abnormalities, localized findings showed hypometabolism in key brain regions, such as the posterior cingulate cortex, and beta-amyloid plaque accumulation in the anterior cingulate cortex. These results highlight the limitations of conventional cognitive assessments, like the MMSE, and underscore the potential value of PET imaging as a complementary diagnostic tool. The study supports the role of 18F-FDG as a stronger indicator of cognitive impairment due to its correlation with cognitive scores, while recognizing the need for further research to evaluate the predictive value of both PET tracers in early MCI detection and their potential to improve diagnostic accuracy.</p>

<p>Bevezetés és célkitűzés:A fülzúgás háttere multifaktoriális, számos kísérő tünettel és provokáló tényezővel találkozhatunk a mindennapi klinikai gyakorlatban. A jelen kutatás célja annak vizsgálata volt, hogy a fülzúgáshoz társuló tünetek és lehetséges provokáló tényezők milyen hatást gyakorolnak a fülzúgás súlyosságára. Módszer:A jelen kutatásba 165, elsődleges szubjektív fülzúgásban szenvedő beteget vontunk be. Minden beteg részletes kivizsgáláson esett át a fülzúgáspanaszokkal kapcsolatban. Ennek részét képezte a társtünetek, a provokáló tényezők felmérése és a Fülzúgásterheltségi Skála kitöltése is. Eredmények:A demográfiai adatok elemzése alapján 40 éves korig férfi-, ezt követően női dominancia figyelhető meg. A panaszok oldaliságának szempontjából a kétoldali (54,5%) és a bal oldali (27,8%) panaszok domináltak. A populáció jelentős hányadán (72,1%) folyamatos fülzúgás jelentkezett. A társtünetek szempontjából a leggyakoribb panasz a szédülés (60%) és a halláscsökkenés (45,5%) volt. Enyhén kisebb arányban, de számottevően társult fejfájás (41%) és füldugulás (35%). Felső légúti infekciós tünet 21%-ban volt jellemző, a zsibbadási (8,4%) és az arcidegbénulási (2,4%) panaszok ritkábbak voltak. Szinte minden esetben fülzúgást provokáló tényezőként igazolódott a csendes környezet (90,3%), a fülzúgást provokáló második leggyakoribb tényező pedig a stressz (66,7%) volt. A fülzúgáshoz ritkábban (27,3%) elalvási nehezítettség társult. Nyakigerinc-ízületi, valamint állkapocsízületi panasz 24%-ban és 17%-ban jelentkezett a vizsgált betegeken. Fronthatás (6%) és zaj (3%) provokáló hatása ritkábban fordult elő. Multinomiális logisztikus regresszió alapján a magasabb életkor (50 év&lt;) (p = 0,019<em>; OR: 0,259, 95% CI = 0,084–0,800) és a nyakigerinc-ízületi panasz jelenléte (p = 0,013</em>; OR: 4,860, 95% CI = 1,405–16,812) szignifikánsan befolyásolta a súlyosabb fülzúgásterheltség megjelenését. Következtetés:A fülzúgáshoz számtalan kísérő tünet és provokáló tényező társulhat, ezek közül a leggyakoribbak a szédülés, a halláscsökkenés, a fejfájás, valamint a csendes környezet és a stressz. A nyakigerinc-ízületi panaszok és a magasabb életkor szignifikánsan befolyásolja a súlyosabb fülzúgás megjelenését. Orv Hetil. 2025; 166(31): 1203–1208.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-5">摘要</h3>
<p>Surgical site infections (SSIs) remain a significant post-operative complication, with rates varying across populations. The COVID-19 pandemic led to heightened infection control measures, which were expected to lower SSI rates. However, existing studies mainly focus on adult populations, leaving a gap in understanding the pandemic’s impact on pediatric surgeries.
We used the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program in Pediatric Surgery (NSQIP-P) database to analyze SSI rates and lengths of stay (LOS) for pediatric patients from 2018 to 2021. We compared data from pre-pandemic (2018-2019) and pandemic (2020-2021) periods, adjusting for confounding variables, such as patient demographics, comorbidities, and surgical specialties.
Among 472,581 cases analyzed, SSI rates increased from 2.5% pre-pandemic to 2.88% during the pandemic. While the percentage of patients with LOS exceeding 2 days slightly decreased, SSI rates for those with prolonged LOS increased, highlighting a strong association between extended hospitalization and SSI risk. Pediatric Otolaryngology had the highest adjusted odds ratio (OR) for SSI (1.393), while pediatric surgery had the lowest (1.097).
Despite enhanced infection control protocols, SSI rates in pediatric surgeries increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings emphasize that infection control measures alone may have been insufficient to mitigate SSIs in pediatric populations, even with efforts to reduce LOS. Further research is needed to explore the pandemic’s broader impact on pediatric surgical outcomes and the relationship between LOS and SSIs.

  <dt>Active travel (AT), particularly cycling, is increasingly recognized as a public health strategy to promote physical activity and prevent non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Given the substantial investments required to build cycling infrastructure, economic evaluations are essential to inform policy and efficient funding decisions. This systematic review aims to identify and assess economic evaluations of cycleway infrastructure, with particular emphasis on the methodological approaches employed.</dt>
  <dt>A systematic review was conducted using databases including PubMed, EconLit, Business Source Premier, CINAHL Plus, and MEDLINE. Eligible studies focused on cycling-specific infrastructure, reported both costs and benefits, and included a comparator. Data were extracted on evaluation type, costs, benefits, perspective, and time horizon. Study quality was assessed using the Drummond checklist, and findings were synthesized narratively, following PRISMA guidelines.</dt>
  <dd>Eight studies met the inclusion criteria, using cost-benefit analysis or cost-effectiveness analysis. Interventions ranged from single cycle tracks to complex networks. Most studies were hypothetical and relied on secondary data and modeling assumptions. All reported positive economic returns.

<h3 id="摘要-7">摘要</h3>
<p>Religion and spirituality have been introduced as a protective or risk factor for suicidal behaviors from different perspectives, so studies need to address this issue. The present study examined the role of religious-spiritual struggles and psychological well-being in predicting suicidal behaviors in a sample of adults in western Iran.
This cross-sectional study was conducted with 407 adults from Kermanshah city, western Iran, between February and April 2024. Participants completed a demographic questionnaire, the Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R), the Religious and Spiritual Struggles (RSS) Scale, and the Psychological Well-Being (PWB) Questionnaire (18 items). Logistic regression analyses were used to identify predictors of suicidal behaviors.
In the present study, 78 (19.2%) of the participants were included in the group with suicidal behaviors. The results of the main variables showed that higher PWB was associated with a lower chance of suicidal behavior (OR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.87-0.98, p-value = 0.007), and higher RSS were associated with a higher chance of suicidal behavior (OR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.08, p-value = 0.043). Women were approximately 2.5 times more likely to have suicidal behaviors than men (OR = 2.53, 95% CI: 1.37-5.92, p-value = 0.005). History of suicide attempt in family and friends was associated with 3 and 1.7 times chance of being in suicidal behavior group, respectively.
The results of this study indicated that PWB was associated with a lower likelihood, while RSS was associated with a higher likelihood of suicidal behaviors among Iranian adults. Additionally, being female and having a history of suicide attempts in family and friends were related to an increased probability of suicidal behaviors. These findings highlight the importance of considering psychological and religious-spiritual factors in understanding the correlates of suicidal behaviors, although longitudinal studies are needed to examine causal relationships.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-8">摘要</h3>
<p>Testosterone therapy (TT) is widely prescribed for hypogonadism. It leads to symptomatic improvement but as with any medication carries risks, as outlined in US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labels.
The current study analyzes TT lawsuits against providers to identify litigation patterns, adverse outcomes, and their implications, informing clinical practices for improved patient safety and reduced legal risk.
We conducted a comprehensive search of the Westlaw and LexisNexis legal databases, covering cases from 2000 to 2024, using the keywords “testosterone” combined with “MD,” “DO,” or “Dr.” We identified cases, excluding those against “Commissioner of Social Security” or “, Inc.” entities, to narrow the focus to individual healthcare providers. A total of 306 cases from Westlaw and 683 from LexisNexis were reviewed. After applying the inclusion criteria, 25 cases were selected for final analysis, with data extracted on treatment type, adverse outcomes, provider specialty, and court rulings.
We sought to characterize common provider specialties, treatment patterns, adverse outcomes, and legal decisions associated with TT-related litigation.
Among the 25 cases involving TT, most involved internal medicine providers (12 cases, 48%), followed by family medicine (4 cases, 16%) and urology (2 cases, 8%). There were 3 cases from 2000 to 2010 and 22 cases from 2011 to 2023. The primary harms included withholding TT (10 cases, 40%), prostate cancer (4 cases, 16%), death (3 cases, 12%), cardiac events (3 cases, 12%), psychiatric effects (2 cases, 8%), and less frequent adverse outcomes, each observed in 1 case (4%), included virilization in female patients and infections or abscesses. Gels (6 cases, 24%) and testosterone injections (5 cases, 20%) were the most frequently involved treatments. Court rulings favored defendants in 9 cases (36%) and plaintiffs in 3 cases (12%). Nine cases (36%) were related to violations of the Eighth Amendment in incarcerated individuals. Seven cases (28%) remain unresolved.
Litigation related to TT often centers on nontreatment and oncologic complications, underscoring the need for guideline-concordant prescribing and thorough risk communication.
The strengths of this study include a two-decade review and focus on provider-level litigation patterns. Limitations include exclusion of settled or sealed cases, and absence of financial data or patient demographics. The small sample size may also limit generalizability.
TT-related lawsuits are increasing, particularly among nonurologists, highlighting the importance of documentation, risk stratification, and communication to reduce legal exposure and improve patient care.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-9">摘要</h3>
<p>IntroductionThe potential for multicancer early detection (MCED) tests to detect cancer at earlier stages is currently being evaluated in screening clinical trials. Once trial evidence becomes available, modeling will be necessary to predict the effects on final outcomes (benefits and harms), account for heterogeneity in determining clinical and cost-effectiveness, and explore alternative screening program specifications. The natural history of disease (NHD) component will use statistical, mathematical, or calibration methods. This work aims to identify, review, and critically appraise the existing literature for alternative modeling approaches proposed for MCED that include an NHD component.MethodsModeling approaches for MCED screening that include an NHD component were identified from the literature, reviewed, and critically appraised. Purposively selected (non-MCED) cancer-screening models were also reviewed. The appraisal focused on the scope, data sources, evaluation approaches, and the structure and parameterization of the models.ResultsFive different MCED models incorporating an NHD component were identified and reviewed, alongside 4 additional (non-MCED) models. The critical appraisal highlighted several features of this literature. In the absence of trial evidence, MCED effects are based on predictions derived from test accuracy. These predictions rely on simplifying assumptions with unknown impacts, such as the stage-shift assumption used to estimate mortality impacts from predicted stage shifts. None of the MCED models fully characterized uncertainty in the NHD or examined uncertainty in the stage-shift assumption.ConclusionThere is currently no modeling approach for MCEDs that can integrate clinical study evidence. In support of policy, it is important that efforts are made to develop models that make the best use of data from the large and costly clinical studies being designed and implemented across the globe.HighlightsIn the absence of trial evidence, published estimates of the effects of multicancer early detection (MCED) tests are based on predictions derived from test accuracy.These predictions rely on simplifying assumptions, such as the stage-shift assumption used to estimate mortality effects from predicted stage shifts. The effects of such simplifying assumptions are mostly unknown.None of the existing MCED models fully characterize uncertainty in the natural history of disease; none examine uncertainty in the stage-shift assumption.Currently, there is no modeling approach that can integrate clinical study evidence.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-10">摘要</h3>
<p>Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), play pivotal roles in glucose homeostasis and metabolic regulation. Therapeutic incretin receptor agonists (RAs), such as tirzepatide, are widely used to manage type 2 diabetes and obesity. However, incretin RAs are facing production challenges at present. Therefore, we engineered transgenic (tg) mice to secrete incretin RAs in milk, leveraging mammary gland bioreactors for cost-effective peptide production. The goat beta-casein promoter-driven constructs encoding tirzepatide-derived peptide linked to human IgG4 Fc via a (GGGGS)₃ spacer were used to produce tg mice. Founders tg-1 and tg-5 exhibited mammary-specific expression, yielding 0.8-1.42 g/l recombinant protein exclusively in milk. Progeny nursed by founders showed sustained hypoglycemia (10-39% reduction; p &lt; 0.05) and marked weight loss (14-49%; p &lt; 0.01) compared to wild-type controls, validating the bioactivity of milk-derived GLP-1/GIP RAs. Moreover, tg-5-nursed offspring experienced high mortality post-Day 16, likely due to overdosing. This proof-of-concept demonstrates the mammary gland bioreactor as a viable platform for incretin RAs production, circumventing complex synthesis and enabling scalable biologics manufacturing.</p>

<p>Bevezetés: A Föld mint életfeltétel a 3. évezredre a környezetterhelések következtében megváltozott, kiváltva a magasabb rendű szervezetek egészségét fenntartó pszichoneuroendokrin immunrendszer működészavarát. Kutatóműhelyünk 25 éve tematikusan foglalkozik homeosztatikus diszruptorhatások modellvizsgálataival, amelyekhez in vivo standardizált kísérleti protokollokat fejlesztett. Ezek által tematikus vizsgálatokban nyílt lehetőség a kémiai hatótényezők hatásainak követésére, például halogénezett, aromás szénhidrogén (hexaklórbenzol : 1,2,4-triklórbenzol 1 : 1 arányban) kombinált hatásainak tekintetében, amelyek igazoltan endokrin diszruptor tulajdonságúak. Célkitűzés: Célunk, hogy egyrészt olyan vizsgálati modellrendszert fejlesszünk, amellyel validált tesztrendszerben vizsgálhatók az endokrin diszruptorok hatásai, másrészt hogy e hatások validált tanulmányozása mellett a tesztrendszer a humán toxicitási potenciál meghatározására is alkalmas legyen, ezáltal biztosítva egy komplex egészségmarker megjelenítését. Módszer: A tesztrendszerben az in vivo vizsgálatokhoz leletezett Wistar hím és nőstény patkányok voltak a modellállatok. A vizsgálatokban a szubtoxicitást májenzimekkel, valamint testtömeg- és fiziológiai leletezéssel kontrolláltuk. Az adatokat SAS-programmal és ANOVA statisztikai elemzéssel értékeltük ki. Az arginin-vazopresszin és az oxitocin plazmaszintjeit RIA- és LIA-módszerrel mértük. Eredmények: Először az expozíciós útvonalat mint valós környezeti hatótényezőt standardizáltuk a reprodukálhatóság és a stabil adatnyerési igények szerint, majd az organizmusszintű szubtoxikus dózistartományt és a szubtoxicitás akut és krónikus követésének időablakait határoztuk meg. A tesztrendszerű hatótényező biológiai hatásainak követéséhez stabil, in vivo kontrollrendszert kellett létrehozni. A klórbenzol hatótényező modellvegyületeket in vivo gastrointestinalis expozíció során optimalizáltuk. Standardizált módon: gastrointestinalis szondán át, napi 1 ml végtérfogatban, 0,1 és 1,0 µg/ttkg dózisokban történtek az expozíciók. A kísérleti idősávok 0–90 napos kezelési periódusúak voltak. Megbeszélés: Munkánk során sikerült olyan tesztrendszert kialakítani, amellyel a kémiai környezetterhelések követésére alkalmas validált módszert hoztunk létre akkreditált laboratóriumi körülmények között. Ezzel a humánegészség-komplex jellemzésére szolgáló szabványos humán toxicitási potenciál meghatározására is alkalmas eljárást alakítottunk ki. Következtetés: Validált tesztrendszert alakítottunk ki a perzisztens szerves szennyező ágensek vizsgálatára, amelyek napjainkban komoly egészségügyi kihívást jelentenek, így vizsgálatuk a klinikai gyakorlatban valós relevanciát képvisel.

<h3 id="摘要-12">摘要</h3>
<p>Cyanobacterial blooms are a significant environmental concern due to their production of toxic metabolites with potential impacts on ecosystem and human health. Microcystin-LR and microcystin congeners are a major concern with respect to human exposure and intoxication, but there are hundreds of characterized cyanobacterial peptides and metabolites that are of interest for their environmental impact in a variety of classes such as cyanopeptolins/micropeptins, microviridins, microginins, and anabaenopeptins. In this study, we report the isolation and characterization of new micropeptins (1-4), a new ferintoic acid (5) a new microginin (6), and three new microviridins (7-9) from a cyanobacterial bloom sample. The new micropeptins, in particular, exhibited unprecedented modifications in their amino acid composition and configuration, which differentiate them from previously known variants. Certain alterations significantly influenced their biological activity with respect to chymotrypsin inhibition and human neutrophil elastase inhibition, highlighting the potential ecological and biomedical relevance of these compounds. We report d-amino acid incorporation into the micropeptins for the first time providing new insights into the chemical diversity of cyanobacterial natural products. These results have important implications for understanding biosynthetic flexibility, the development of bioactive agents for therapeutic applications, and highlight the need for reference materials for mass spectrometry-based metabolite annotation.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-13">摘要</h3>
<p>Eating a plant-rich diet is considered essential for human and planetary health and the Mediterranean diet offers a realistic way to increase this. Gaining greater knowledge of the barriers and drivers to consuming the Mediterranean diet in residents of high-income countries was the aim of the current study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 adults residing in Australia who ate either an omnivore or plant-rich diet. Using reflexive thematic analysis (RTA) and the behaviour change wheel (BCW), an in-depth exploration of these barriers and drivers was conducted. Key barriers were: (1) changing ingrained meat habits, (2) lack of physical and mental availability, (3) household influences, (4) meat perceived as tasty and Mediterranean diet foods as bland and (5) minimal knowledge of the nutritional benefits of Mediterranean diet foods. Our findings emphasize the need to consider multiple individual and environmental barriers when designing behaviour change interventions to increase Mediterranean diet adoption.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-14">摘要</h3>
<p>Hand eczema and facial skin problems are common occupational-related skin diseases. However, the data regarding care workers in community care settings are limited. To assess the prevalence and factors associated with hand eczema and facial skin problems among community care personnel, an online questionnaire link was sent to 10,194 personnel in Sweden, with questions regarding hygiene routines, skin problems, and demographics of the participants. Respondents were categorized into groups regarding their skin symptoms. In all, 1,923 (18.9%) responded (89.8% females; 75.9% assistant nurses and care assistants). The 1-year prevalence of hand eczema and facial skin problems was 34.7% and 45.5%, respectively. Dose-dependent associations were found between occupational exposure to soap and water and hand eczema, and duration of face mask use and facial problems. Also, a higher perceived level of stress, female sex, atopic dermatitis, and lower age group were associated with both hand eczema and facial skin problems. In conclusion, healthcare workers in community care have an increased risk of occupationally related skin symptoms, foremost hand eczema, but also facial symptoms related to the use of face masks. Thus, efforts to reduce the harmful effects from the risk factors should be the main concern.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-15">摘要</h3>
<p>Immigrant workers constitute a major portion of farmworkers in the United States, and their number has been gradually increasing over the years. These workers are among the most vulnerable to occupational injury and illness because of constraints in communication, lack of medical insurance, cultural beliefs, and discriminatory practices. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health’s (NIOSH) Centers for Agricultural Safety and Health (Ag Centers) were established with the aim of reducing injuries and illnesses in the agriculture, forestry, and fishing (AgFF) sectors through research, education, and prevention projects. Diversity of populations served by these Ag Centers is identified as a challenge for assessing the impact of the centers. Employing sensitive lenses like culturally responsive evaluation (CRE) is critical in the evaluation of Ag Centers, because it captures cultural nuances that might have affected the implementation and/or outcome of the project. We conducted a scoping review of the literature in CRE to identify practical strategies for CRE implementation. We categorized the findings into four deductively formed groups about cultural competence: acknowledge the complexity of cultural identity, recognize the dynamics of power, recognize and eliminate bias in language, and employ culturally appropriate methods.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-16">摘要</h3>
<p>People with heart failure (HF) are at higher risk of experiencing severe cardiac complications including hospitalization and death, from seasonal influenza infection. In addition to preventing influenza infections, influenza vaccination’s effect on preventing hospitalization and death may impact its cost-effectiveness among people with HF. Moreover, uncertainty of its cost-effectiveness has been reported as a barrier for public funding of influenza vaccination in such populations.
We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of a program of seasonal influenza vaccination for patients with HF upon discharge from hospital, compared to usual care, in China. The analysis involved four-health-state Markov model in which we modelled a hypothetical cohort of patients discharged alive with HF from county-level hospital cardiology wards in Henan Province, China. The intervention is provision of free influenza vaccine on the day of hospital discharge, with treating physician’s recommendation, and convenient Point of Vaccination (PoV) within the hospital. The comparator is usual care, which generally would be advice at discharge to attend a community based PoV. We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis from a health system perspective with a one-year time horizon. Outcomes were cost, influenza-like-illness (ILI), readmission, death, and quality-adjusted life year (QALY).
The intervention strategy had an overall cost of US$ 2,456 per person per year compared to the cost of $2,899 per person per year with usual care. The intervention strategy resulted in 0.57 QALYs per person per year, compared to 0.53 QALYs under usual care. The intervention strategy was dominant over usual care - with estimated cost savings of $443 and 0.03 higher QALYs per patient discharged alive over 12 months. Overall, implementing the influenza vaccination strategy in a cohort of 1,000 individuals results in 28 less ILI cases, 164 fewer hospitalizations, and 44 fewer deaths per 1,000 patients discharged alive, and overall cost savings of $443,000 over this period. In one-way sensitivity analysis, the intervention strategy remains robustly cost-effective across a wide range of assumptions. The probability of intervention strategy being cost-effective is 84 %, at the willingness-to-pay threshold of $37,668 per QALY.
Although very few hospital wards routinely offer influenza vaccination for patients on discharge, doing so has the potential to both save lives and reduce government health care expenditure.

<h3 id="摘要-17">摘要</h3>
<p>Cerebral atherosclerosis is a significant contributor to ischemic stroke, accounting for approximately 50% of ischemic strokes in some populations. Its prevalence and associated mortality exhibit variation across demographics, yet no prior studies have assessed the location of death for individuals succumbing to cerebral atherosclerosis. This study evaluates trends in mortality, racial disparities, and location of death in the United States.
Data from the CDC WONDER database were analyzed, including all deaths attributed to cerebral atherosclerosis. We conducted analyses using both underlying cause of death (primary cause) and multiple causes of death (any mention of the condition). Variables analyzed included race, ethnicity, sex, age group, year of death, geographic region, urban-rural status, and location of death. A multinomial logistic regression model was used to assess factors influencing the location of death, with odds ratios (ORs) calculated.
From 1999 to 2022, cerebral atherosclerosis was listed as the underlying cause of death in 83,978 cases and as either an underlying or contributing cause in 162,489 deaths. Decedents were predominantly White (87.7 % underlying, 88.5 % multiple) and female (65.9 % underlying, 63.8 % multiple), with the majority aged ≥ 85 years (68.6 % underlying, 62.9 % multiple). The most common locations of death were nursing homes (42.2 % underlying, 42.2 % multiple) and home (38.4 % underlying, 33.6 % multiple). Older age was consistently associated with a higher likelihood of death outside the hospital, particularly at home (OR ≥ 85 years: 3.08 underlying, 4.24 multiple) or in hospice (OR ≥ 85 years: 2.00 underlying, 4.24 multiple). African American decedents had lower odds of dying at home (OR: 0.52 underlying, 0.57 multiple) and in nursing homes (OR: 0.35 underlying, 0.40 multiple). Year, geographic region, and urban/rural status also significantly influenced the location of death in both analyses, demonstrating complex regional and temporal trends.
Significant demographic and racial disparities exist in the location of death for individuals with cerebral atherosclerosis. These findings highlight the need for targeted interventions to address disparities in end-of-life care and improve access to preferred settings of death, particularly for minority populations.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-18">摘要</h3>
<p>To explore the association between retirement status (normal vs. nonnormal) and depressive symptoms, focusing on the interaction of retirement status with self-assessed health.
Using data from the 2020 China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), 390 retirees aged 45 and older were analyzed. Depressive symptoms were measured using the CESD-10. Retirement status was categorized into normal and non-normal, and self-assessed health as healthy or unhealthy. Multilevel regression models were used to examine the associations and interactions between retirement status and depressive symptoms, adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, and health-related factors.
The association between non-normal retirement and depressive symptoms (β=3.52, P = 0.001) and the interaction between non-normal retirement and unhealthy self-assessment (β = 4.58, P = 0.04) are statistically significant.
Non-normative retirement is associated with higher depressive symptoms among Chinese retirees, particularly among those with poor self-rated health. Targeted interventions and increased retirement policy flexibility are recommended.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-19">摘要</h3>
<p>This study examined the association between problematic smartphone use (PSU) and risk behaviors among Korean adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also aimed to develop preventive measures for adolescent health promotion in the event of future pandemics.
A secondary analysis of data from the 16th Korean Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey (2020) was conducted, which included 54,948 middle and high school students. Smartphone use, PSU, alcohol use, and smoking status were assessed via self-reported questionnaires. Complex samples descriptive statistics and logistic regression analyses were performed using SPSS 25.
Korean adolescents averaged 282.8 and 393.4 min of smartphone use across weekdays and on weekends, respectively, with a 25.5% prevalence of PSU. Female and high school students exhibited significantly higher PSU rates (p &lt;.001). Current alcohol use and smoking increased PSU risk by 1.098- and 1.295-fold, respectively.
The findings emphasize the need for intervention strategies targeting PSU and associated risk behaviors. Continuous monitoring in home and school settings, along with gender-specific and educational-level interventions, is recommended to promote healthy smartphone use among adolescents.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-20">摘要</h3>
<p>Advancements in genetic analysis have revealed a higher prevalence of hereditary kidney disease than expected. This study focuses on the enrollment and analysis of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and a family history of CKD to identify disease-causing variants. Additionally, by incorporating data from childhood urine tests, the study examines the utility of these screenings in early disease detection.
An observational study utilizing genetic data and clinical assessments from patients with familial CKD. A total of 85 patients with familial CKD, diagnosed by clinicians and confirmed through genetic testing from 2014 to 2020, were included. Patients with cystic kidney diseases were excluded. The presence of COL4As (COL4A3, COL4A4, COL4A5) gene variants and other genetic variants associated with kidney disease was examined using a comprehensive gene panel.
Of the patients, 41.2% had disease-causing variants in COL4As variants. The median age at manifestation onset was significantly lower in the COL4As group compared to patients with other disease-causing variants or those with no identified disease-causing variants. Early manifestations of microscopic hematuria were notably prevalent, indicating potential early markers for genetic kidney diseases.
The findings underscore the importance of family history in diagnosing genetic kidney diseases and suggest that early genetic testing, coupled with regular monitoring of urinary abnormalities, could significantly improve disease management and outcomes. Further research is necessary to explore comprehensive genetic screening and its integration into routine clinical practice.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-21">摘要</h3>
<p>Influenza A viruses (IAVs) initially infect a few host cells before spreading to neighboring cells. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this dissemination remain unclear. We have previously demonstrated that intracellular Ca2+ plays a crucial role in facilitating IAV infection. This study aims to clarify the connections between intracellular Ca2+ dynamics and spread of IAV infection.
Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells stably expressing a Ca2+ indicator for optical imaging were established. Cells were cultured in Matrigel to form monolayers, and cell-to-cell Ca2+ dynamics within IAV-infected cells were analyzed using fluorescence microscopy.
IAV infection upregulated the frequency of intercellular calcium wave propagations (iCWPs), facilitating viral spread. ADP released from initially infected cells mediated iCWPs via the P2Y1 receptor. P2Y1 antagonist suppressed both the generation of iCWPs and spread of viral infection. Enhanced endocytosis by the surrounding cells that received ADP signaling upregulated viral entry. Expression of IAV matrix protein 2 (M2) in initially infected cells triggered iCWPs through ADP diffusion, thereby increasing infection. Conversely, an ion permeability-deficient mutation of M2 or inhibition of its ion channel activity suppressed iCWPs.
Intercellular calcium signaling plays a crucial role in the early expansion and establishment of IAV infection, presenting a potential target for IAV prophylaxis.</p>

<p>This study examined the effects of the REsilient Attitudes and Living for Professionals (REAL Pro) prevention intervention on the well-being of professionals who work with children and families. The program combines mindfulness and self-compassion practices with cognitive-behavioral tools that aim to promote improved stress management, emotion regulation and well-being, and was evaluated with early childhood (n = 87) and K-12 educators (n = 40), staff serving youth in out-of-school or after-school settings (n = 31), and medical providers (n = 35). Participants completed pre- and post-test assessments, reporting on measures of stress management (perceived stress, self-compassion), emotion regulation (dysregulation, active coping, denial), and well-being (flourishing, resilience, burnout, secondary trauma symptoms). Dependent sample t-tests were conducted, showing significant improvement from pre- to post-test in self-compassion, emotion regulation, active coping, and a trend toward increased resilience. Three-month follow-up in a small subset of the sample (n = 11) suggested potential delayed reduction in burnout and secondary trauma symptoms. Satisfaction surveys and qualitative data indicated high participant satisfaction with the program and that participants made use of and perceived benefits from the skills for themselves and their clients. The preventive intervention shows promise for providing professionals with tools for stress management and emotion regulation, with the potential for reducing burnout in providers working with children and families who tend to experience substantial work-related stress.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-23">摘要</h3>
<p>People who inject drugs (PWID) engage in risky behaviours that can spread infections like HIV. Addressing these intertwined issues is crucial, starting by lessening individual perceptions and actual practices of every high-risk behaviour that increases the incidences of the disease in this most vulnerable population. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of high-risk injecting behaviour among people who inject drugs in Zanzibar.
We conducted a cross-sectional study of randomly selected 1308 PWIDs from Unguja and Pemba Islands of Zanzibar in Tanzania. Participants were selected from known hot spots, methadone clinics, sober houses and health facilities. A standardized structured questionnaire that evaluates high-risk injecting habits was used for data collection. Descriptive analysis was used to generate proportions of high-risk injecting practices, followed by a multivariate logistic regression analysis of predictors of high-risk injecting behaviour. A p-value of &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Over half of the participants (50.5%) engaged in high-risk injecting behaviours. High-risk injecting behaviours included using ‘used needles in the last 6 months’ (40.5%), sharing needles used in the last injection (53.2%) and sharing other instruments (50.4%). Multiple logistic regression identified the following factor as associated with high-risk injecting behaviour: age 25-29 (AOR = 2.29, 95%CI = 1.29-4.03), 30-34 (AOR = 3.09, 95%CI = 1.82-5.23), 40 and above AOR = 1.84, 95%CI = 1.07-3.17) were seen to increase the likelihood of high-risk injecting behaviour. Residing in a lower spot area (AOR = 1.728, 95%CI = 1.19-2.51) and the methadone clinic (AOR = 2.28, 95%CI = 1.48-3.53) were also associated with high-risk injecting behaviours. Being female (AOR = 0.628, 95% CI = 0.43-0.92) presents with a lower likelihood. Using injection drugs for 11 years and more (AOR = 2.28, 95% CI = 1.29-4.02) increases the chance of engaging in high-risk injecting and injection as their primary method of taking the drug (AOR = 1.65, 95%CI = 1.05-2.59), injecting drugs twice a day (AOR = 3.36, 95%CI = 2.20-5.14) and more than three times a day (AOR = 4.23, 95%CI = 2.73-6.56) increased the likelihood of high-risk injecting behaviour.
This study found high-risk injecting behaviour among PWIDs. The study revealed positive associations between high-risk injecting behaviour and an increase in age, residing in low-spot areas and methadone clinics, frequent injections, long-term drug usage, and forearm injection sites. These findings highlight an urgent need for a framework for providing preventive, treatment and care services for PWIDs, including scaling up access to health promotion interventions and customised harm-reduction services.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-24">摘要</h3>
<p>Transformation of cardiac fibroblasts into matrix-producing myofibroblasts plays an important role in tissue repair and fibrosis after myocardial injury. Tcf21 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that is essential for the development of cardiac fibroblasts and the epicardium. Myofibroblasts are derived from Tcf21 (+) residual fibroblasts; however, whether Tcf21 itself promotes fibrosis is still unknown. Since Tcf21 deficiency leads to perinatal lethality, cardiac fibroblasts were isolated from Tcf21-knockout mouse embryos, and mice that lack Tcf21 after birth were generated (inducible Tcf21 KO, iTcf21). In vitro analysis revealed that Tcf21 promoted cell proliferation and upregulated the expression of extracellular matrix genes. Notably, the Pdgfrb-Erk pathway was severely suppressed in Tcf21-knockout fibroblasts. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing assay demonstrated the direct binding of Tcf21 to COL1A1, COL3A1, IL6, and PDGFRB loci. Integrated analysis identified pathways involved in fibroblast activation, extracellular matrix production and cell proliferation. Moreover, iTcf21 mice were resistant to cardiac fibrosis induced by isoproterenol injection or metabolic overload with streptozotocin-induced diabetes and a high-fat diet. Our results demonstrate a critical role for Tcf21 in the transformation of cardiac fibroblasts into activated myofibroblasts. It directly binds to gene loci and works in a pro-fibrotic manner via Pdgfrb signaling.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-25">摘要</h3>
<p>Resistant hypertension (RH) is defined as office systolic blood pressure (BP) that remains uncontrolled despite the concurrent use of three or more antihypertensive drug classes and may be associated with altered vasomotor responses to physiological stimuli. However, the effect of RH on cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) remains poorly understood. Furthermore, the potential contribution of autonomic nervous system dysfunction to these alterations has not yet been fully clarified. Understanding these mechanisms may offer insights into the pathophysiology of resistant hypertension and could have important prognostic implications. This study aims to analyze CVR in a cohort of patients with RH, compared with patients with non-resistant hypertension (NRH), taking into account the differences in sympathovagal balance between the two groups. Forty consecutive hypertension patients, 20 with NRH and 20 with RH, underwent heart rate variability analysis and transcranial color-coded Doppler at rest and during a breath-holding maneuver to evaluate CVR. Hypertensive individuals presented a significant reduction of the Breath Holding Index (BHI) and time-domain parameters (SDNN and SDANN) in comparison to the control group (BHI control 1.32 ± 0.41 vs hypertensive 0.92 ± 0.65; p = 0.018; SDANN control 125.76 ± 24.96 vs hypertensive 87.65 ± 20.63; p &lt; 0.0001). RH patients presented a significant reduction in BHI (NRH BHI 1.15 ± 0.65 vs RH BHI 0.70 ± 0.58; p = 0.027) and HRV parameters (SDANN in NRH 95.09 ± 22.12 vs RH 80.21 ± 16.36; p = 0.021). Our results show that RH is associated with impaired HRV and CRV. Autonomic dysfunction could be a concurrent cause of cerebral vasomotor reactivity impairment.</p>

<p>During prostate aging collagen-IV is modified by advanced glycation end-products, inducing crosslinking of the basement membrane surrounding glandular acini. Basement membrane stiffness sensed by Endo180 disrupts its suppressor complex with CD147, triggering epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and limiting survival in prostate cancer patients. Here we report basement membrane stiffness and Endo180 cooperate in rewiring epithelia for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and growth suppressor evasion, cell proliferation promotion, cell death resistance, inflammation, invasion and metastasis without affecting genome instability, highlighting a non-oncogenic biomechanical event in age-related neoplasia. Endo180-CD147 complex coupled to OXPHOS in Gleason 6 and in Gleason ≥7 tumors Endo180 uncoupled from CD147-OXPHOS, identifying a bio-switch for invasive cancer. Endo180 correlated with patient age in normal tissue, Gleason 6 and 7, but not Gleason 8 tumors, suggesting biological age unleashes its suppression of tumorigenesis. Application of Endo180-based diagnostics in age-related glandular cancers could inform treatment decisions, improving quality of life and survival.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-27">摘要</h3>
<p>The Hudson River (HR), New York, has been rapidly warming, with water temperatures increasing 1 °C between 1946 and 2006 and projected to rise at an even faster rate in the future. Atlantic tomcod Microgadus tomcod is a cold water, estuarine, Gadidae species whose current southern distribution along the Atlantic coast of North America is truncated by warming waters. Currently, the HR supports their southernmost spawning population whose abundance is in severe decline. We used controlled laboratory experiments to investigate the effects of projected warming HR wintertime water temperatures on a number of fitness measures in tomcod embryos and larvae. We found that higher temperatures increased hatch rate, growth rate, heart rates, mortality of larvae, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The number of DEGs identified by RNA-Seq analysis (≥ 2-fold change, FDR &lt;0.1) increased when comparing the control 2.7 °C temperature group to the higher temperature exposure groups. For example, the number of DEGs was 349, 565, and 1286 when comparing the control exposure group to the groups exposed to 3.5 °C, 6.2 °C, and 8.3 °C water temperatures, respectively. DEGs genes were linked to stress response, cardiac health, and protein homeostasis. These findings indicate that Atlantic tomcod respond to temperature stress by downregulating energy-intensive processes like protein homeostasis, posing potential long-term health risks to its HR population.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-29">摘要</h3>
<p>Cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome, characterized by interconnected cardiovascular, renal, and metabolic dysfunctions, poses a growing global health burden. While both light at night (LAN) and air pollutants have independently been linked to adverse health outcomes, their synergistic and joint effects on CKM syndrome risk remain poorly understood. This study aimed to assess the independent, interactive, and joint associations of LAN, air pollutants, and PM2.5 components with CKM syndrome.
Data from 4,361 participants aged ≥ 45 years in the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS, 2011-2015) were analyzed. Cox proportional hazards regression models were employed to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for CKM syndrome risk. Multiplicative and additive interactions between LAN and air pollutants were assessed using likelihood ratio tests and relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI). Joint effects were evaluated by categorizing exposures into tertiles.
Over a median follow-up of 4.2 years, 792 incident CKM syndrome cases were identified. Adjusted models indicated that higher LAN exposure (highest vs. lowest quartile: HR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.18-1.80) and increased levels of NO₂ (HR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.18-1.75), PM2.5 (HR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.19-1.87), PM10 (HR = 1.75, 95% CI: 1.40-2.18), NO₃⁻ (HR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.15-1.75), and NH₄⁺ (HR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.15-1.75) were independently associated with elevated CKM risk. Significant multiplicative interactions were observed between LAN and all pollutants except O₃, NO₃⁻, and NH₄⁺ (P for interaction &lt; 0.05). In the additive interaction analysis, the RERI values ranged from 0.158 to 0.792, indicating a significant synergistic effect between LAN and air pollutants, which increases the risk of CKM syndrome. Joint exposure analysis showed that the combination of high LAN and high PM₁₀ increased CKM risk by 56.3% (HR = 1.563, 95% CI: 1.092-2.238), while moderate co-exposure to LAN and PM2.5 elevated risk by 33.4% (HR = 1.334, 95% CI: 0.872-2.041).
This study provided evidence that LAN, air pollutants, and PM2.5 components were positively associated with CKM syndrome, and significant synergistic and joint effects existed, increasing the risk of CKM syndrome in older adults. These results highlighted the urgency of comprehensive environmental intervention measures and emphasized the necessity of incorporating multi-factor joint exposure assessment in future CKM syndrome research.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-30">摘要</h3>
<p>While ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) are extensively associated with population health, no studies have yet assessed the potential association between concurrent exposure to these two pollutants and physical function (PF) in middle-aged and elderly individuals. By collecting data from three phases of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), we included 8834 follow-up observations from 4110 participants aged 45 years and older who had undergone at least two physical examinations between 2011 and 2015. PF scores of enrolled participants were assessed through four objective tests including grip strength, balance, walking speed, and repeated chair stands. Annual average concentrations of PM2.5 and O3 prior to physical tests were assigned to participants at the prefecture-level residence in each survey. A linear mixed-effects model was used to evaluate the effects of long-term exposure to PM2.5 and O3 on PF, adjusting for multiple covariates including sociodemographic, behavioral, and health status. Stratified analyses were performed to compare the effects of PM2.5 under low- and high-level O3 groups and the effects of O3 under low- and high-level PM2.5 groups. Additive interactive effects were testified by introducing a 2 × 2-level dummy variable to model the joint exposure of PM2.5 and O3. Each 10-µg/m³ increase in PM2.5 and O3 exposure was associated with a declined PF score of -0.561 points (95% confidence interval: -0.617, -0.506) and -1.154 points (-1.341, -0.968), respectively. Stratified analyses for co-pollutants indicated weakened effects of PM2.5 and O3 at higher co-pollutant levels (PM2.5: -0.448 [-0.522, -0.373]; O3: -0.796 [-1.070, -0.522]) than at lower levels (PM2.5: -0.608 [-0.708, -0.507]; O3: -1.293 [-1.612, -0.974]). Despite greater effects in the case of simultaneous high-level exposures to both pollutants, we did not identify any evidence for additive interactive effects of co-exposures to PM2.5 and O3 in the total and age- and sex-subgroup populations. This study provided novel evidence for the independent and modifying effects of long-term exposure to PM2.5 and O3 on impaired PF in middle-aged and elderly people.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-31">摘要</h3>
<p>Digital labour platforms are transforming work organization, offering new opportunities but also raising concerns about precarious conditions and health risks. Despite increasing attention to platform work, limited research has examined its direct impact on workers’ physical, mental, and social well-being.
The objective of this scoping review is to examine current empirical studies investigating the health effects of working via digital labour platforms, aiming to (i) summarize the existing evidence, (ii) pinpoint knowledge gaps, and (iii) identify areas for methodological enhancements.
We search for peer-reviewed studies published until December 2024 from Web of Science and PubMed, alongside grey literature. Inclusion criteria covered papers with original data, using qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods, resulting in 40 included studies. A pre-established theoretical framework guided result reporting, emphasizing three characteristics affecting worker health: (i) business practices, (ii) employment conditions, and (iii) work environment hazards.
In summary, literature shows a link between digital platform work and poor health. The current evidence, mainly focused on mental health and location-based platform workers, highlights factors contributing to poor physical and mental health, including low-quality employment conditions and psychosocial work environment hazards. Limited evidence suggests a correlation between business practices-algorithmic management and rating systems-and poor mental health. Knowledge gaps include the health impact of web-based platforms, especially medical consultation ones and location-based domestic and care services platforms, and less-explored outcomes like musculoskeletal pain and occupational injuries. Methodological limitations, such as low sample size and lack of control groups, were noted.
This review identifies methodological improvements and knowledge gaps, guiding future research to comprehend the impact of digital platform work on health. As legislation evolves to enhance platform workers’ job conditions, researching their health is crucial for offering practical recommendations and shaping evidence-based policies.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-32">摘要</h3>
<p>Low back pain, one of the musculoskeletal disorders is among the major global public health problems and contributors to disability and workers’ absence in occupational areas which certainly disrupts work productivity and the expected results. Though various studies investigated low back pain, the results were inconsistent and inconclusive enough, and there is no representative data in low- and middle-income countries on this public health concern. This in turn hinders the efforts of various intervention activities. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to determine the pooled prevalence of low back pain and its associated factors among weavers of low- and middle-income countries.
All the relevant articles were retrieved from databases such as PubMed/MEDLINE, CINAHL, LIVIVO, African Journals Online, African Index Medicus (AIM), HINARI, Science Direct, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, and Google. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guideline was followed for this study. The extracted data were analyzed using STATA 17 software. With a 95% confidence interval, this meta-analysis with the random-effects model was conducted to determine the pooled prevalence.  RESULT: A total of twenty articles with 7211 study participants were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of low back pain was 55.81%. Age, working in a chair with no back support, working in an uncomfortable posture, work experience, and job stress were the factors significantly associated with low back pain.
A high prevalence of low back pain among weavers in low-and middle-income countries was registered. This indicates the need to take effective intervention measures. Rigorous provision of ergonomic training, providing lengthy breaks, improving workplace ergonomic design, and increasing job satisfaction are recommended.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-33">摘要</h3>
<p>Physical inactivity is common among young adults. Transitions from school to work can affect available resources for engaging in physical activity (PA). There is a lack of longitudinal data examining changes in PA following status transitions differentiated by occupational and academic career paths. The aim of this study was to analyze changes in PA of young adults across four status transitions from: (1) school to vocational education and training (VET), (2) school to university, (3) VET to workforce entry, and (4) university to workforce entry.
A longitudinal analysis was conducted using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (waves 2014-2020) for young adults aged 18-35. McNemar tests and logistic fixed-effects regressions were performed in four separate subsamples with paired data (time points before and after a transition).
In total, 364 individuals transitioned from school to VET (47.8% women, mean age before transition (BT): 18.9, SD = 1.2), 482 from school to university (53.7% women, mean age BT: 19.0, SD = 1.4), 790 from VET to workforce entry (46.6% women, mean age BT: 22.2, SD = 3.3), and 305 from university to workforce entry (54.4% women, mean age BT: 26.3, SD = 3.0). A significant reduction in PA was observed when individuals transitioned from 1) school to VET and 4) university to workforce.
Young adults who choose an occupational career path already experienced a reduction in PA when starting VET, whereas this trend is temporally shifted for those choosing an academic career path, occurring only upon entry into the workforce. Tailored interventions (e.g., digital approaches that are flexible in terms of time and location) are needed to promote PA among the identified groups, considering available resources.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-35">摘要</h3>
<p>As the care home sector expands over time, the health and social care needs of both residents and staff intensify and diversify. These sector-wide changes call for significant growth in research capacity to deliver useful, pertinent and timely evidence. In this paper we highlight growing pressures in the care home sector, and the major and enduring barriers to conducting research across that sector, within homes and amongst staff, drawing primarily on our experiences conducting public health research in England. These obstacles include a lack of national infrastructure, tradition and culture, and underdeveloped systems to reimburse providers for the staff and other costs associated with research delivery. Finally, we detail short, medium and long-term actions that could enable the growth of research capacity across the sector. These include leveraging political will, remunerating and crediting research champions, and establishing a feedback loop to showcase the contribution of research in improving both quality of care and resident outcomes. Our suggested actions focus on what would be required to build research capacity in care homes in England; although these also have relevance in other countries where there is a need and wish to build research capacity in adult long-term care facilities.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-36">摘要</h3>
<p>Cellular membranes are dynamic, heterogeneous structures where lipid nanodomains (e.g., lipid rafts) play key roles in signalling, membrane trafficking, and protein function. Single-Molecule Localisation Microscopy (SMLM) reveals the spatial organisation of these nanoscale features; however, traditional analyses focus only on spatial patterns and neglect biochemical and biophysical properties critical for membrane function. By combining SMLM with environmentally sensitive fluorescent probes, such as di-4-ANEPPDHQ, we can produce marked point patterns which couple spatial coordinates with environmental information, such as membrane lipid order quantified by generalised polarisation (GP) values. Unfortunately, existing methods do not adequately compare these complex datasets. Here, we introduce a new method, which assesses the similarities of marked point patterns by considering the spatial arrangement as well as the biophysical properties of the data. The method computes three semi-independent Kolmogorov-Smirnov scores which are used to map comparisons between two point-clouds in 3D space. This allows the distance to the origin of a comparison to be used as a metric for similarity. Application to simulated data confirms the reliability of the method, while application to experimental GP-marked point patterns identifies condition-dependent variations in lipid order. This framework thus offers a versatile tool for the study of biochemical and biophysical properties of cellular nano-environments, enabling new insight into membrane organisation and function.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-37">摘要</h3>
<p>Cross-sectional studies have shown a well-established relationship between post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use disorders, particularly, heroin dependence. The present study examines the prevalence, correlates and predictors of PTSD over the longer term among people with a history of heroin dependence.
This study explored PTSD outcomes at the 18-20-year follow-up of the Australian Treatment Outcomes Study, a prospective longitudinal study of 615 people with heroin dependence recruited from Sydney, Australia in 2001-2002. Structured interviews asked participants about demographic characteristics, drug use history and dependence, mental health and patterns of treatment seeking for heroin dependence. Group comparisons between those with and without PTSD were conducted to identify correlates of PTSD at 18-20-years. Logistic regression with backwards stepwise elimination was conducted to identify baseline predictors of PTSD at 18-20-years follow-up.
Of the 615 people assessed at baseline, 393 provided complete PTSD data at 18-20-year follow-up. Of those, 16 % met diagnostic criteria for current PTSD. Individuals with PTSD had increased odds of meeting criteria for cannabis dependence, being in current opiate treatment, experiencing a major depressive episode in the past month and lifetime suicide attempt (ORs range 1.85-4.32). Baseline predictors of PTSD at 18-20-year follow-up included female sex, a history of incarceration and current PTSD diagnosis.
This study showed PTSD remained prevalent among a cohort of people with a history of heroin dependence, and was associated with poorer long-term clinical outcomes across substance use and mental health domains. Additionally, individuals with PTSD demonstrated poorer occupational functioning and greater treatment utilisation. The finding that baseline PTSD diagnosis was a predictor of PTSD at 18-20-years stresses the need to provide effective and immediate evidence-based treatment for those with co-occurring PTSD and heroin dependence.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-38">摘要</h3>
<p>Evidence-based interventions often fail to translate into practice. This study aims to identify facilitators and barriers that affect the implementation of Let’s Talk about Children (LTC), a family-focused intervention for families of children with parental mental illness (COPMI). Furthermore, we aim to offer actionable strategies to scale up LTC in China.
We assessed 48 Consolidated Framework for Implementation (CFIR) constructs and selected 10 constructs. We conducted focus groups guided by the CFIR to describe diverse stakeholders’ experience during the implementation process. Eight sites in China were selected based on geographic and economic feasibility. Focus groups were audio-recorded and transcribed for analysis.
Implementation facilitators identified included: (1) acceptance of advantages, (2) adaptability, (3) access to knowledge and information, (4) fulfilled needs, (5) strong motivation, (6) teamwork. Study participants expressed mixed views on: (1) compatibility, that is, integration with workflow processes, and (2) engagement, that is, effect of attracting and encouraging participation. Implementation barriers included: (1) local attitudes on mental health, and (2) local resources, both of which were in the Outer Setting domain. Actionable strategies scaling up the implementation of LTC intervention were summarized.
As the advantages of the LTC program were widely recognized during our initial implementation, tailored training for mental health staff is essential to facilitate the development of family-focused practices to address the needs of COPMI and their families. Long-term efforts are necessary to decrease the negative impact of the identified barriers and refine the LTC program for future scalability.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-39">摘要</h3>
<p>Poor childhood health negatively affects health and socioeconomic status later in life. One crucial policy tool is the modification of co-payment conditions, which can cause parents to experience more rigid budget constraints and cause reductions in the number of prescription drugs given to their children.
This study estimates the price sensitivity of prescription drug demand using data on all prescription drug purchases for the non-adult population in Catalonia from 2010 to 2015.
We use a sharp regression discontinuity design (RDD) with no bandwidth, exploiting 2012 reforms in Catalonia (Spain).
Our results indicate overall reductions in the defined daily dose (DDD) consumption over three years post-reform for children of parents who experienced increases in their co-payment levels (8.1 % for a 10 % increase). In contrast, those whose parents did not experience a reduction in co-payment rates had a 7.0 percentage point increase in the number of prescriptions used. We corroborated our findings by considering drug stockpiling. Interestingly, prescriptions related to females showed higher reductions than those for males. Disentangling drug consumption by type of condition, we show that drug purchases related to respiratory health conditions experienced smaller reductions and, more specifically, the ones associated with asthma, compared to mental health diseases such as Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.
We evidence significant changes in overall drug consumption for young people in Spain following the reforms of co-payments.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-40">摘要</h3>
<p>Tuberculosis (TB), a chronic zoonotic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, remains a major public health burden worldwide. The increasing threatens of multidrug-resistant/extensively drug-resistant TB, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection, lack of effective vaccines and diagnosis methods, as well as the low treatment efficacy of anti-TB therapeutics lead to multiple difficulties and challenges in TB control. Host immune defense is critical for the processes and outcome of Mtb infection control due to the complex immune evasion mechanisms of Mtb, thus, it’s of vital importance to characterize the host immune responses and mechanisms during Mtb infection. Nitric oxide (NO) has complex physiological functions in different conditions and has been shown to play important roles in the immune defenses against Mtb infection and even direct killings of Mtb, which still requires further systemic evaluations. In this review, we summarized the current understanding for the roles and mechanisms of NO in host defenses during Mtb infection, as well as the role of NO in the occurrence, development and treatment of TB, which may provide theoretical basis for the development of novel strategies in the prevention and control of TB and drug-resistant TB.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-41">摘要</h3>
<p>Germany has long lagged behind other high-income countries in terms of implementing evidence-based prevention policies. This is reflected by the relatively low life expectancy of the population, high numbers of non-communicable diseases and health inequality in the country. Against this backdrop, we discuss the initial plans of the new German government for prevention, and suggest a way forward. By shifting from a focus on curative measures to evidence-based, population-level interventions, Germany can improve health outcomes, reduce inequalities, and save costs. Strategic leadership and a coherent national prevention strategy are essential to achieve this transformation.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-42">摘要</h3>
<p>People with multiple sclerosis (MS) report modifying their diet to improve wellbeing; however, the overall prevalence of diet modification in this population is unknown.
To assess the prevalence of diet modification among people with MS.
A systematic literature review was performed July 2024 in four databases (Ovid Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection). Inclusion criteria were: 1) studies including adults with MS and 2) reporting the prevalence of diet modification. Random effects inverse-variance meta-analyses determined the prevalence of current and lifetime diet modification as well as subgroup analyses based on global region, survey date, sample size, and risk of bias (RoB). The protocol was registered August 2024 at PROSPERO (CRD42024573284).
Among 39 studies reporting on 43 independent samples with 48,104 participants with MS, 13,808 cases of lifetime diet modification were reported for an overall prevalence (95 % CI) of 0.22 (0.17, 0.27). Additionally, among 23 studies reporting on 27 independent samples with 25,338 participants with MS, 4,893 cases of current diet modification were observed for a prevalence (95 % CI) of 0.17 (0.11, 0.23). High heterogeneity was present and was explained by age, sex, MS duration, global region, survey year, sample size, and RoB, which was moderate/high for 74 % of included samples and drove the very low quality of evidence rating for both outcomes.
Diet modification was common among people with MS with the highest prevalences observed in North America, Oceania, and international cohorts, along with an increasing trend over time.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-43">摘要</h3>
<p>We examined the outcomes of patients with sepsis and septic shock admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in a tertiary care hospital in Saudi Arabia over 16 years.
A retrospective cohort study was carried out using data collected prospectively in an ICU database. We included all patients admitted between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2017, with sepsis defined by Sepsis-3 criteria. The primary outcome was hospital mortality. In addition, adjusted logistic regression models was used to evaluate the change in hospital mortality over time.
Of 12,645 patients admitted to the ICU during the study period, 5917 patients (46.8 %) met the criteria for sepsis (median age= 65 years [interquartile range: 52, 75], median Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation Score II [APACHE II] score= 24 [interquartile range: 19, 31], 44.8 % were women and 32.3 % had septic shock). Among patients with sepsis and septic shock, chronic comorbidities were common. Between 2002 and 2017, there was a progressive decrease in APACHE II score and hospital mortality (among patients with sepsis: crude odds ratio (OR) for each 1-year increase 0.95, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.94-0.97; APACHE II-adjusted OR 0.96, 95 % CI 0.95-0.98; among patients with septic shock: crude OR 0.93, 95 % CI 0.91-0.95; APACHE II-adjusted OR 0.96, 95 % CI 0.94-0.98). The mortality reduction in patients with sepsis seems to have occurred in the 2010-2017 period (adjusted OR for each 1-year increase 0.88, 95 % CI 0.85-0.91 versus adjusted OR 0.99, 95 % CI 0.96-1.04 for the 2002-2009 period). A similar pattern was observed in patients with septic shock.
Patients with sepsis constituted almost half of patients admitted to the ICU. During the 16-year study period, there was a decline in hospital mortality over time among patients admitted with sepsis and septic shock, which occurred mainly from 2010 to 2017.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-44">摘要</h3>
<p>Parotitis, commonly associated with the mumps virus, can also result from other viral infections. We report a case series of 21 children and preadolescents presenting with mumps-like parotitis in Southern Italy between January and February 2025, all of whom had been vaccinated against mumps. In all cases, mumps virus was not detected by real-time PCR in clinical samples. Alternative etiologies were investigated by testing for a broad panel of pathogens. Viral infections were identified in 16 cases (76.2 %), with influenza A/H3N2 being the most common pathogen (14 cases, 87.5 %), followed by rhinovirus and coronavirus NL63. Of the 14 patients positive for influenza A/H3N2, 10 had received influenza vaccine. Whole genome sequencing of A/H3N2 viruses from three samples was performed, and phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene revealed that they belonged to the A/H3N2 subclade 2a.3a.1 (J.2), clustering with other regional viruses from the 2024 ̶ 2025 season. No unexpected genetic variations were found in target genes that would suggest changes in tissue tropism. Given the emergence of influenza A/H3N2 as a potential etiological agent of non-mumps parotitis, particularly during epidemic periods, enhanced surveillance and comprehensive diagnostic approaches are needed to improve understanding of the epidemiology of non-mumps parotitis.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-45">摘要</h3>
<p>Gynecologic cancers are among the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among female patients, with over 80 % of patients experiencing persistent or long-term effects even after curative treatment. Abdominopelvic complications can arise from the disease itself or treatment-related factors. Tumor-related complications include effects from locoregional invasion (malignant bowel obstruction, obstructive uropathy), tumor rupture (and associated hemorrhage), hypercoagulability (leading to deep vein thrombosis), and infections (including tumor fistulization to the bowel or lower urinary tract, abscesses, pyometra, and/or superinfected necrosis). Treatment-related complications can be subdivided into those following surgery, radiotherapy, or systemic therapy, including immunotherapy. Postoperative complications include paralytic ileus, obstructions, fistulas, anastomotic leaks or strictures, vaginal cuff dehiscence, wound infections, lymphocele, and lymphedema. Radiotherapy-related toxicities include acute toxicities of diarrhea, cystitis, and vaginal mucositis, as well as chronic toxic effects, including radiation enteritis, bladder dysfunction, fistulas, pelvic insufficiency fractures, and sexual dysfunction. Complications of cytotoxic chemotherapy and targeted agents include myelosuppression, neuropathy, mucositis, neutropenic enterocolitis, pneumatosis intestinalis, bowel perforation, tumor-to-bowel fistula, pancreatitis, nephrotoxicity, osteoporosis, and bone loss. Immunotherapy-related toxicities include colitis, enteritis, hepatitis, and pancreatitis. The role of the radiologist in the detection and characterization of these complications is paramount, as imaging is integral to timely diagnosis and multidisciplinary management. An awareness of the spectrum of abdominopelvic complications affecting gynecologic oncology patients is essential to maximal diagnostic accuracy and optimal patient care.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-46">摘要</h3>
<p>Dengue fever, a major mosquito-borne disease (MBD), continues to impose a growing global burden fueled by urbanization, climate change, and increased human mobility. Accurate predictive models are crucial for early detection and outbreak mitigation. This study aimed to develop and compare hierarchical models, with and without lagged predictors, for forecasting dengue cases in Oman.
A retrospective analysis was conducted using weekly data from 2020 to 2024 across multiple districts. Predictors included climate variables (temperature, humidity, wind, rainfall), mosquito surveillance indicators (trap positivity, mosquito density), and population demographics. Four hierarchical Bayesian models were developed: Poisson without lag, Poisson with lag, Negative Binomial without lag, and Negative Binomial with lag. Models incorporated fixed effects and random intercepts for epidemiological week, district, governorate, year, and seasonal components. Model performance was evaluated through convergence diagnostics, Mean Squared Error (MSE), Area Under the Curve (AUC), confusion matrices, and Leave-One-Out Information Criterion (LOOIC).
All models demonstrated excellent convergence and fit the historical weekly data (2020-2024) accurately. The Negative Binomial model with lagged variables performed best, achieving the highest AUC (0.881, 95 % CI: 0.858-0.902), the lowest LOOIC (3234.6 ± 109.4), and the smallest MSE. Mosquito trap positivity was consistently the strongest predictor, while wind speed showed a moderate positive effect and temperature showed significant delayed negative effects. Rainfall, humidity, and population size were not significant predictors. Importantly, short-term forecasts for the first weeks of 2025 closely matched the observed case counts, confirming that the models’ prediction metrics reflected both retrospective fit and real-world forecasting performance.
Incorporating delayed climatic and entomological factors using a Negative Binomial hierarchical framework significantly enhanced dengue outbreak prediction in Oman. The findings support the integration of lagged predictors and hierarchical modeling into early warning systems for mosquito-borne diseases, facilitating timely public health interventions and improved outbreak preparedness.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-47">摘要</h3>
<p>Successful poultry producers aim to maximize their meat, egg, or offspring yields while also satisfying the quality expectations of consumers. Even when raised under controlled conditions, poultry are exposed to diverse stressors, such as the hatching process, transportation from hatcheries to farms, vaccination, presence of mycotoxins in feedstuffs, and transportation to slaughter houses, which can have unfavorable impacts on their immunity, productivity, reproductive performance, meat, egg yield, and quality. Curcumin (Cur) is a polyphenolic bioactive molecule found in turmeric, which is used as a natural feed additive in poultry production. The antioxidant characteristics of Cur are due to its chemical structure. Cur can improve the meat quality, such as the color and polyunsaturated fatty acid contents, as well as reducing the drip loss and malondialdehyde concentration in meat. Cur can enhance egg quality characteristics, such as the eggshell strength, yolk color, Haugh unit score, yolk contents of monounsaturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids, and yolk Cur concentration. Serotonin secretion is stimulated by Cur, and it prevents heat shock protein 70 and corticosterone production in stressed poultry. Thus, Cur can boost immunity and the effectiveness of vaccinations, and decrease the likelihood of diseases. Therefore, Cur could be applied as an important feed additive and a suitable choice for poultry producers, but it is necessary to know how to select the most appropriate form and level of supplementation before adding Cur to the diets of poultry. The present review clearly describes the impacts of different Cur forms and concentrations of the active substance on poultry production, as well as considering its mode(s) of action. Clarifying the mode(s) of action for Cur could help to identify new uses for Cur that will require examination.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-48">摘要</h3>
<p>The prevalence of central nervous system infections caused by carbapenem-resistant organisms is on the rise, posing a growing threat to public health. Polymyxin is deemed as one of the “last resort” options. In this study, we analyzed the therapeutic efficacy of three dosing regimens of polymyxin B: intravenous (IV), intraventricular (IVT) or intrathecal (ITH) (denote as IVT/ITH), and IV combined with IVT or ITH (denote as combination therapy).
The retrospective study was conducted at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine. There were 53 patients in the IV group, 71 in the IVT/ITH group, and 106 in the combination group. The clinical characteristics, treatment process, and the results of relevant tests were documented.
Clinical outcome (classified as clinical success, clinical relief and clinical failure), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathogen clearance rate, and 28-day all-cause mortality were the three primary evaluation criteria. Concerning the clinical outcome, the IV group was inferior to the IVT/ITH (P = 0.032) and the combination group (P = 0.008). The CSF pathogen clearance rate of the combination group was superior to that of the IV group (P = 0.001) and the IVT/ITH group (P = 0.041). The 28-day all-cause mortality was lower in the IVT/ITH group (P = 0.018) and the combination group (P = 0.004) compared to the IV group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the route of delivery of polymyxin B was associated with 28-day all-cause mortality (P = 0.001).
The IVT/ITH and IV combined with IVT/ITH use of polymyxin B can effectively reduce mortality and achieve better clinical outcomes, while the combination regimen performed better in eradicating CSF pathogens.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-49">摘要</h3>
<p>Physical exercise can transiently decrease pain intensity within a single session and improve physical capacities while reducing pain over a training program. However, the pain trajectory throughout a concurrent physical training program remains unknown. This study aimed to model the pain trajectory during a training program including both aerobic and resistance exercises, considering both acute (within-session) and chronic (across-program) effects of physical exercise.
Prospective observational study.
Participants completed a 14-week training program (42 sessions; n = 28) or were assigned to a waiting list (n = 29). In the exercise group, low back pain intensity was measured before and after each training session. Pain intensity in the past week was measured before and after the 14-week period in both groups. The pain trajectory was modeled using linear mixed-effects with a quadratic term to capture potential non-linear pain reduction.
Past week pain decreased only in the exercise group (exercise: 4.9 ± 0.3 vs 2.5 ± 0.3; control: 5.6 ± 0.3 vs 5.3 ± 0.3). The pain trajectory was characterized by a linear and a quadratic term (p’s &lt; 0.001), suggesting pain reduction is greater early in the training program. Pain intensity decreased after each training session (p &lt; 0.001) with this effect remaining constant throughout the program (non-significant interactions, p’s &gt; 0.585).
Pain decreases more markedly during the initial weeks of the program. Acute exercise-induced hypoalgesia persisted throughout the program, suggesting patients may use physical exercise to manage pain flare-ups even after several weeks of training.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-50">摘要</h3>
<p>To inform policies and programs designed to prevent lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and promote bladder health among different social groups, this research utilized RISE FOR HEALTH data to examine potential health inequities in LUTS and bladder health by different indices of socioeconomic position, as well as ethnic and racial social identity. Data were collected in 2022-2023 from 3322 adult women from nine regions of the United States. Higher socioeconomic position-regardless of whether it was measured as education, percent federal poverty level, or health insurance coverage and type-was associated with fewer, less frequent LUTS and better bladder health independent of ethnic and racial identity. These findings are consistent with the broader literature on LUTS, while also extending this literature to encompass different facets of bladder health, including perceived impact of bladder health status on social and occupational activities, physical activity, travel, and emotions. Poorer bladder health among women of Hispanic ethnic identity relative to Non-Hispanic White women appeared to be largely driven by socioeconomic disadvantage. Independent of socioeconomic position, women who identified as Non-Hispanic Black or Non-Hispanic Asian reported better bladder health relative to Non-Hispanic White women. Future qualitative research may be useful in identifying health promoting attitudes, behavioral habits, and intergenerational messages about caring for the bladder that can be incorporated into health promotion programs tailored to women’s ethnic and racial identity, as well as universal programs. Consistent with the World Health Organization’s Conceptual Framework for Action on Social Determinants of Health (Solar and Irwin, 2010), findings highlight the importance of policies that ensure equitable access to health promoting resources, including education, poverty-alleviating assistance, and high-quality health care.

<h3 id="摘要-51">摘要</h3>
<p>Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is highly prevalent among elderly patients. One of the primary target organs for T2DM is the kidneys. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between reduced kidney function and the risk of hypoglycemia in elderly female patients with T2DM and to develop a predictive model for this risk. The study included 150 female patients aged 60-74 years with T2DM, among whom hypoglycemia was observed in 58 (38,7%) patients. The medical history of T2DM, dynamic blood glucose levels, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), serum creatinine, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the CKD-EPI formula were analyzed. Statistically significant differences were found between the study groups in terms of T2DM duration, eGFR, minimum and final blood glucose levels (all p&lt;0,001), as well as maximum glucose levels and HbA1c (p=0,005). Patients with hypoglycemia more frequently had chronic kidney disease. A direct correlation was observed between eGFR and minimum (p&lt;0,001) and last (p=0,041) blood glucose levels. Multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed that decreased eGFR and duration of T2DM are significant risk factors for hypoglycemia. Based on this method, a diagnostic model for assessing hypoglycemia risk was developed. A ROC curve was constructed (AUC=0,884, p&lt;0,001), with a logistic function cutoff value of 0,38 (indicating a 38% hypoglycemia risk) selected as the threshold. Thus, decreased eGFR and duration of T2DM are predictors of hypoglycemia in elderly patients with T2DM.
Сахарный диабет 2-го типа (СД2) широко распространен у пожилых пациентов. Одним из основных органов-мишеней для СД2 являются почки. Цель исследования — выявление взаимосвязи снижения функции почек и риска гипогликемии у пациенток пожилого возраста с СД2 и создание модели для прогнозирования этого риска. В исследование были включены 150 пациенток 60–74 лет с СД2, из которых гипогликемия была отмечена у 58 (38,7%). Были проанализированы анамнез СД2, изучены показатели гликемии в динамике, уровень гликированного гемоглобина, креатинин в сыворотке крови, рассчитана СКФ по формуле CKD–EPI. Между обследуемыми группами выявлены статистически значимые различия по продолжительности заболевания СД2, СКФ, минимальному и последнему показателям гликемии (все p&lt;0,001), а также по максимальному уровню глюкозы и гликированному гемоглобину (p=0,005). Пациентки с гипогликемией чаще страдали ХБП. Обнаружена прямая корреляция СКФ с минимальным (p&lt;0,001) и последним (p=0,041) показателями гликемии. Многофакторный логистический регрессионный анализ подтвердил, что снижение СКФ и стаж СД2 являются значимыми факторами риска гипогликемии. На основе данного метода разработана диагностическая модель оценки риска гипогликемии. Построена ROC-кривая (AUC=0,884, p&lt;0,001), в качестве точки отсечения выбрано значение логистической функции 0,38 (риск гипогликемии 38%). Таким образом, снижение СКФ и длительность СД2 являются предикторами гипогликемии у пожилых пациентов с СД2.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-52">摘要</h3>
<p>Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Treatment of elderly patients with NHL has always been a challenge; however, treatment statistics have begun to show favorable results similar to those of younger patients with DLBCL, thanks to new treatment protocols. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of prognostic factors on survival and efficacy of therapy in elderly patients with DLBCL in the Republic of Crimea. This study included 87 patients diagnosed with DLBCL who were treated in the Department of Hematology and Chemotherapy of the N.A. Semashko Republican Clinical Hospital from 2008 to 2024. The mean age was 72 (65-89) years, and 13 (14,9%) patients were over 80 years old. The median follow-up time was 42 months, and 45 patients (51,7%) died during the follow-up period. The median overall survival (OS) was 55 months, and the median progression-free survival was calculated as 27 months. Sixty-three patients (72,4%) received standard therapy R-CHOP. Complete response was achieved in 46 patients (52,9%). The median survival for patients with complete response was 136 months (p&lt;0,001); however, OS was not statistically different between elderly (&gt;80 years) and young patients (p=0,236). According to our results, we believe that the opportunity to undergo standard therapy R-CHOP is vital for the survival of elderly patients with DLBCL.
Диффузная В-крупноклеточная лимфома (ДВККЛ) является наиболее распространенным типом неходжкинской лимфомы. Лечение пожилых пациентов с неходжкинской лимфомой всегда было сложной задачей, однако статистика лечения начала показывать благоприятные результаты, аналогичные таковым у молодых пациентов с ДВККЛ, благодаря новым протоколам лечения. Цель исследования — оценка влияния прогностических факторов на выживаемость и эффективность терапии пожилых пациентов с ДВККЛ в Республике Крым. В исследование были включены 87 пациентов с диагнозом ДВККЛ, которые проходили лечение в отделении гематологии и химиотерапии Республиканской клинической больницы им. Н.А.Семашко в период 2008–2024 гг. Средний возраст пациентов составил 72 (65–89) года, 13 (14,9%) пациентов были старше 80 лет. Медиана времени наблюдения составила 42 мес. 45 (51,7%) пациентов умерли в течение периода наблюдения. Медиана общей выживаемости составила 55 мес, а медиана выживаемости без прогрессирования была рассчитана как 27 мес. 63 (72,4%) пациента получили стандартную терапию R-CHOP. Полный ответ был достигнут у 46 (52,9%) пациентов. Медиана выживаемости для пациентов с полным ответом составила 136 мес (р&lt;0,001). Однако общая выживаемость статистически не отличалась между пожилыми (&gt;80 лет) и молодыми пациентами (р=0,236). Согласно результатам, возможность пройти стандартную терапию R-CHOP жизненно важна для выживаемости пожилых пациентов с ДВККЛ.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-53">摘要</h3>
<p>The growing older adults’ population made their well-being as a global concern. Considering the cultural and contextual differences across societies, it is essential to explore the dimensions of well-being within each specific context. This study aims to identify the dimensions of well-being from the perspective of Iranian older adults. This study employed a qualitative approach, conducting 21 in-depth interviews with older adults, selected through purposive sampling across different districts of Tehran. The interviews were analyzed based on directed content analysis. The findings were compared to a framework developed from a prior scoping review. Six dimensions of well-being identifies in the theoretical framework were confirmed through the interviews, though some subcategories differed. Key findings included: independence and autonomy in daily life and the burden of high healthcare expenditures under the Health dimension; warm family relationship and child’s well-being in Social Relationships; inadequate income and financial hardship in Economic Status; recreational activities and trips in Environment and Leisure; and the role of education and literacy in Capabilities and Resources. Economic challenges were particularly impactful on the subjective well-being of older adults. Economic difficulties, peaceful family environment and children’s well-being emerged as significant factors in the well-being of Iranian older adults compared to previous theoretical framework.
Увеличение численности пожилых людей сделало их благополучие глобальной проблемой. Учитывая культурные и контекстуальные различия между обществами, важно исследовать проблему благополучия в каждом конкретном контексте. Цель исследования — определение факторов благополучия с точки зрения пожилых людей Ирана. В данном исследовании использовали качественный подход, было проведено 21 углубленное интервью с пожилыми людьми, отобранными с помощью целенаправленной выборки в разных районах Тегерана. Интервью анализировали на основе направленного контент-анализа. Результаты сравнивали с концепцией, разработанной на основе предыдущего обзора. Шесть факторов благополучия, определенных в теоретической структуре, были подтверждены в ходе интервью, хотя некоторые подкатегории различались. Основные результаты включали независимость и автономию в повседневной жизни и бремя высоких расходов на здравоохранение в факторе здоровье; теплые семейные отношения и благополучие ребенка — в социальных отношениях; недостаточный доход и финансовые трудности — в экономическом статусе; развлекательные мероприятия и поездки — в окружающей среде и досуге; роль образования и грамотности — в возможностях и ресурсах. Экономические проблемы особенно влияют на субъективное благополучие пожилых людей. Экономические трудности, мирная семейная обстановка и благополучие детей стали значимыми факторами благополучия иранских пожилых людей по сравнению с предыдущей теоретической концепцией.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-54">摘要</h3>
<p>With age, the frequency of cardiovascular diseases increases, which makes сhronic heart failure (CHF) one of the most common pathologies in the elderly. CHF in elderly and senile patients, complicated by postinfarction left ventricular aneurysm (LVA), is a serious problem in clinical practice. Postinfarction aneurysm of the left ventricle, which occurs after a myocardial infarction, significantly worsens the prognosis, leading to a violation of heart function and an increased risk of cardiovascular complications. The article presents an overview of publications on the epidemiology of chronic heart failure in patients with LVA, including age and gender aspects. Based on the analysis of available publications, modern views on the problem of the emergence of LVA are highlighted. The data testifying to the prognostic significance of LVA as a factor associated with the aggravation of the course and the development of cardiovascular complications in patients with CHF are presented.
С возрастом увеличивается частота сердечно-сосудистых заболеваний, что делает ХСН одной из наиболее распространенных патологий у пожилых людей. Данное заболевание у пациентов пожилого и старческого возраста, осложненное постинфарктной аневризмой ЛЖ (ПИАЛЖ), является серьезной проблемой в клинической практике. ПИАЛЖ, возникающая после инфаркта миокарда, значительно ухудшает прогноз, приводя к нарушению функции сердца и увеличению риска сердечно-сосудистых осложнений. В статье представлен обзор публикаций, посвященных эпидемиологии ХСН у пациентов с ПИАЛЖ, включая возрастные и гендерные аспекты. На основе анализа доступных публикаций освещены современные взгляды на проблему возникновения ПИАЛЖ. Приведены данные, свидетельствующие о прогностической значимости ПИАЛЖ как фактора, ассоциированного с отягощением течения и развитием сердечно-сосудистых осложнений у пациентов с ХСН.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-55">摘要</h3>
<p>In the modern world, considerable attention is paid to cardiovascular diseases, which, according to WHO, remain the leading cause of death. One of the key risk factors for their development is metabolic syndrome (MS), the prevalence of which is steadily increasing. An increase in the number of people with obesity, changes in eating behavior and reduced physical activity contribute to the progression of MS, and also affect the composition and functional state of the intestinal microbiota. In recent years, more and more data indicate that the microbiota plays an important role not only in the pathogenesis of MS, but also in the aging process. Gerontology considers intestinal microflora as one of the targets for action in order to slow down age-related changes and reduce the risk of age-associated diseases, including cardiovascular pathologies. Intestinal dysbiosis can contribute to the development of systemic inflammation, insulin resistance and atherosclerosis, which makes the study of its mechanisms in the context of gerontology particularly relevant. The search for new links in the pathogenesis of MS and its relationship with changes in the microbiota opens up prospects for the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies, which, in turn, can contribute to an increase in the duration and quality of life. The purpose of the review is to analyze and systematize modern scientific data on the relationship between intestinal microbiota, metabolic syndrome and aging processes, to identify new pathogenetic mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of age-associated diseases. The work uses publications, mainly for the last 5 years, from the PubMed, eLIBRARY, ScienceDirect databases, including review articles, meta-analyses and clinical studies.
Сегодня значительное внимание уделяется сердечно-сосудистым заболеваниям, которые, согласно данным ВОЗ, продолжают оставаться ведущей причиной смертности. Одним из ключевых факторов риска их развития является метаболический синдром (МС), распространенность которого растет. Увеличение числа людей с ожирением, изменения в пищевом поведении и сниженная физическая активность способствуют прогрессированию МС, а также оказывают влияние на состав и функциональное состояние кишечной микробиоты. В последние годы все больше данных свидетельствует о том, что микробиота играет важную роль не только в патогенезе МС, но и в процессах старения. Геронтология рассматривает кишечную микрофлору как одну из мишеней воздействия для замедления возрастных изменений и снижения риска возраст-ассоциированных заболеваний, включая сердечно-сосудистые патологии. Дисбиоз кишечника может способствовать развитию системного воспаления, инсулинорезистентности и атеросклероза, что делает изучение его механизмов в контексте геронтологии особенно важным. Поиск новых звеньев патогенеза МС и его связи с изменениями микробиоты открывает перспективы для разработки эффективных стратегий профилактики и лечения, что, в свою очередь, может способствовать увеличению продолжительности и качества жизни. Цель обзора — анализ и систематизация современных научных данных о взаимосвязи кишечной микробиоты, МС и процессов старения, выявление новых патогенетических механизмов и потенциальных терапевтических мишеней для профилактики и лечения возраст-ассоциированных заболеваний. В работе использованы публикации, преимущественно за последние 5 лет, из баз данных PubMed, eLIBRARY, ScienceDirect, включая обзорные статьи, метаанализы и клинические исследования.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-56">摘要</h3>
<p>More and more studies are focused on the functions of sirtuin proteins in the pathogenesis of joint diseases. Numerous experimental data illustrate the biological functions of sirtuins in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis in terms of inflammation and cellular aging. The literature also mentions the role of sirtuins in the regulation of circadian rhythms, which have recently been recognized as one of the key aspects in the development of joint pathologies. Some representatives of the sirtuin protein family can participate in the regulation of mitochondrial functions. Over the past three decades, evidence has been obtained that sirtuins are not only important energy sensors, but also have protective properties against metabolic stress and premature aging of cells. Sirtuins regulate metabolism, inhibit apoptosis and autophagy of chondrocytes, and prevent aging of cartilage tissue by exhibiting their deacetylating function. This review shows the role and participation of sirtuins in various molecular signaling events that are associated with the suppression of the functional activity of chondrocytes with increasing age. Modern studies demonstrate the positive effect of sirtuins on the functional activity of chondrocytes and cartilage anabolism. The development of possible ways to regulate sirtuin activity is of considerable interest, which can lead to progress in the treatment of joint pathology.
Всё больше исследований сосредоточено на изучении функций белков сиртуинов в патогенезе заболеваний суставов. Многочисленные экспериментальные данные иллюстрируют биологические функции сиртуинов в патогенезе остеоартрита с точки зрения воспаления и клеточного старения. В литературе также упоминается роль сиртуинов в регуляции циркадных ритмов, которые недавно были признаны одним из ключевых аспектов в развитии суставных патологий. Некоторые представители семейства белков сиртуинов могут участвовать в регуляции функций митохондрий. За последние три десятилетия были получены доказательства того, что сиртуины не только являются важными энергетическими сенсорами, но и обладают протекторными свойствами в отношении метаболического стресса и преждевременного старения клеток. Сиртуины регулируют метаболизм, ингибируют апоптоз и аутофагию хондроцитов, а также предотвращают старение хрящевой ткани, проявляя свою деацетилирующую функцию. В данном обзоре показана роль и участие сиртуинов в различных молекулярных сигнальных событиях, которые связаны с угнетением функциональной активности хондроцитов с возрастом. Современные исследования демонстрируют положительное влияние сиртуинов на функциональную активность хондроцитов и анаболизм хряща. Разработка возможных путей регуляции активности сиртуинов представляет значительный интерес, который может привести к прогрессу в лечении патологии суставов.</p>
