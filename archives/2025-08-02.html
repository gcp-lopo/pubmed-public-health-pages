<h2 id="article-1">1. Experiences of Community-Living Adults With Pressure Injuries: A Qualitative Systematic Review With Thematic Synthesis.</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: The American journal of occupational therapy : official publication of the American Occupational Therapy Association
<strong>发表日期</strong>: 2025-Sep-01
<strong>链接</strong>: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40748916">PubMed</a></p>

<h3 id="摘要">摘要</h3>
<p>Occupational therapy practitioners provide interventions to adults with pressure injury (PI) in their home. However, little is known about these adults’ experiences of living with PI in the home environment. Current guidelines are biomedically focused and based on research primarily in hospital or institutional settings.
To synthesize experiences from qualitative studies of people living at home with PI.
Six databases were searched (CINAHL, ProQuest Central, Scopus, Cochrane Reviews, MEDLINE, and Embase).
Qualitative studies examining experiences of adults with PI living at home, published in English from 2000 to 2024, were included. Two researchers independently screened records for eligibility by title and abstract and by full text. Experiences were extracted from the studies and analyzed thematically.
Of the 2,245 records identified, 14 reporting experiences of living with PI at home met the inclusion criteria and were included. Six overarching themes described these experiences: (1) living with occupational deprivation; (2) living with pain, smell, and sleep deprivation; (3) living with fear, anxiety, and uncertainty; (4) finding ways to cope with grief and loss; (5) learning health self-efficacy and occupational balance; and (6) sharing the journey with health professionals.
Guidelines for practitioners working with adults with PI at home are urgently needed. Occupational therapy practitioners can intervene by supporting engagement in meaningful occupation, preventing occupational deprivation, and promoting occupational balance, particularly for adults requiring bedrest or activity restriction. Research should be expanded to include adults with cognitive impairment and palliative disease, children, and rural residents. Plain-Language Summary: This study aimed to understand the experiences of adults living at home with pressure injury because current guidelines are hospital focused. The study found that different guidelines are needed for care at home. Adults living with pressure injury at home are limited in their activities and experience pain, smell, sleep deprivation, anxiety, and uncertainty. They need to cope with grief, take charge of their health, and balance activity with rest. Health professionals can improve well-being by having definite home visit times, ensuring smooth and continuous care, and helping adults make their own decisions about pressure injury care. Occupational therapy practitioners should support meaningful activities, balance activity and rest, and match assistive technology to home needs. Alternatives to bedrest are needed, and pain and sleep issues need to be addressed. This study helps occupational therapy practitioners better understand the experiences of people living with a pressure injury at home and calls for more research with people with cognitive impairment or palliative conditions, as well as with children and people living in rural settings.</p>

<h2 id="article-2">2. Cognitive Impairment and Dementia-Related Diagnoses in Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: Neurology
<strong>发表日期</strong>: 2025-Aug-26
<strong>链接</strong>: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40749155">PubMed</a></p>

<h3 id="摘要-1">摘要</h3>
<p>Clinical features of individuals with autopsy findings of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) have been described for 50 years. Clinical criteria have been proposed, although cognitive correlates of CTE remain unknown. This study examined whether CTE was related to dementia and patterns of cognitive impairment to summarize the clinicopathologic evidence.
A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed, composed of a multicenter interdisciplinary team. Five databases were searched from their inception to March 2025. Original studies involving participants with neuropathologic findings of CTE and neuropsychological data were included. A multistage selection approach was used, including a review by neuropathologists to ensure that studies conformed to CTE consensus criteria. Methodological quality was rated from 9 items using a modified Murad Case Report Methodological Quality Tool. The main outcomes of interest were domains of cognitive functioning, based on objective testing, and prevalence of dementia-related clinical diagnoses in individuals with CTE. A random-effects meta-analysis examined prevalence of dementia-related diagnoses, and meta-regression examined whether Alzheimer-type neuropathology or any comorbid neuropathology was a moderator.
A total of 36 studies comprising 563 unique CTE cases were included. Only 22 CTE cases (&lt;5%) had objective neuropsychological data available from studies (k = 10) of acceptable quality. Deficits in memory, language, and attention were the most prevalent cognitive features, but all cases had comorbid non-CTE neuropathologies that may have been associated with cognitive impairment. Diverse neuropsychological impairments were observed, resulting in no consistent cognitive pattern, even for high CTE severity. Dementia-related diagnoses were prevalent (62%; 95% CI 48%-75%) in the meta-analysis (k = 13; n = 492), yet not strongly related to non-CTE neuropathologies recorded (estimate = 0.14, 95% CI -0.62 to 0.91; p = 0.714), including Alzheimer-type neuropathology (estimate = 0.21, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.45; p = 0.084).
Limited CTE cases have been published with objective neuropsychological information. CTE cases show cognitive deficits resembling Alzheimer dementia, but a direct clinicopathologic link is inconclusive. While the meta-analytic findings suggest that CTE may be associated with cognitive impairment, further investigation is needed because heterogeneity in study designs prohibits clear conclusions. To realize any clinicopathologic links and inform future iterations of clinical criteria, a transition in how cognition is investigated in CTE will be needed and several research directions are proposed.</p>

<h2 id="article-3">3. Disparities in Internet Medical Service Utilization Among Patients in Post-COVID-19 China: Cross-Sectional Study of Data From Provincial Field and National Online Surveys.</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: Journal of medical Internet research
<strong>发表日期</strong>: 2025-Aug-01
<strong>链接</strong>: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40749207">PubMed</a></p>

<h3 id="摘要-2">摘要</h3>
<p>Internet medical services (IMS) expanded rapidly in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, disparities in internet medical services utilization (IMSU) have marginalized disadvantaged groups of Chinese patients from digital health benefits. The extent and nature of these disparities remain poorly understood, with no research comprehensively addressing how unfavorable predictors, including demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related factors, shape IMSU status, patterns, and preferences in China after the COVID-19 pandemic.
This study aims to gain a deeper understanding of the disparities and unfavorable predictors that limit IMSU among Chinese adult patients following the COVID-19 pandemic, providing key reference points for advancing equitable IMSU.
This cross-sectional study used a triangular approach, combining data from a provincial field survey conducted in July 2023 and a national online survey conducted in March 2024. Participants were Chinese adult outpatients aged 18 years or older. Descriptive and comparative analyses were used to examine disparities in IMSU status, patterns, and preferences across different demographic, socioeconomic, and health status-related factors. Binary logistic regression models were applied to assess the associations between unfavorable predictors (constructed from selected demographic, socioeconomic, and health status-related factors) and IMSU status, patterns, and preferences.
Of the 2011 eligible participants in the Jiangsu provincial field survey, 787 (39.13%) reported using IMS at least once in the previous 12 months. Among the 1611 eligible participants in the national online survey, all reported accessing IMS during the same period; however, only 481 (29.86%) reported high-frequency use (defined as usage in the third quartile or above, ie, ≥6 times). Overall, participants with unfavorable predictors were less likely to engage in IMSU, deep IMS were used less frequently than shallow IMS, and participants with 6 or more cumulative unfavorable predictors had the lowest total of IMSU preference score (mean 48.98 and 57.37 in the provincial field and national online surveys, respectively). Based on combined data from the provincial field and national online surveys, significantly negative associations were observed between unfavorable predictors and IMSU status, patterns, and preferences. In particular, participants aged 60 years or above (odds ratio [OR] 0.40, 95% CI 0.25-0.63, P&lt;.001) and those without everyday internet access (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.41-0.71, P&lt;.001) were the least likely to use IMS at a medium-to-high frequency. Participants without private health insurance (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.44-0.79, P&lt;.001) were the least likely to utilize deep IMS. Moreover, participants aged 60 years or above (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.33-0.63, P&lt;.001) and those with a high school education or less (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.55-0.82, P&lt;.001) were the least likely to prefer IMS to a moderate-to-strong degree.
Widespread disparities in IMSU status, patterns, and preferences persisted among Chinese adult patients after the COVID-19 pandemic. More pro-disadvantaged patient policies may be warranted to narrow these disparities in IMSU, such as reimbursement for IMSU, to promote digital health equity in China.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-3">摘要</h3>
<p>Perioperative outcomes for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have not been previously described following spine surgery. This study used PearlDiver to examine the 90-day postoperative outcomes and 4-year revision rates after posterior lumbar fusion (PLF) for patients with CF compared with matched controls.
This study examined a cohort of PLF patients with versus without CF. Patients were matched 1:10 for age, sex, Elixhauser Comorbidity Index, and the number of levels. Ninety-day postoperative outcomes and 4-year revision rates were compared.
One hundred twenty-seven patients with CF were matched with 1263 controls without CF. On multivariable logistic regression, those with CF had statistically significantly increased 90-day odds of the following: venous thromboembolism (odds ratio [OR], 4.2), pleural effusion (OR, 3.4), dyspnea (OR, 3.2), respiratory failure (OR, 2.8), pneumonia (OR, 2.6), acute kidney injury (OR, 2.4), hospital readmissions, (OR, 2.2), and emergency department visits (OR, 2.1). Notably, patients with CF were not at increased odds of 4-year subsequent lumbar surgery.
Patients with CF were at significantly increased odds of pulmonary and other defined adverse events. These findings are pertinent in the perioperative risk assessment, patient/family recommendations, and surgical preparations for patients with CF being considered for PLF.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-4">摘要</h3>
<p>The indirect health risks of tropical cyclones (TCs), the costliest climate extremes, remain unclear, with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) being a major contributor. We applied two-stage time-series analysis to 6.54 million CVD hospitalizations across six countries/territories (Canada, New Zealand, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam) between 2000 and 2019 to quantify the long-term risks and burden of CVD hospitalizations following TCs. Hospitalization risks for cause-specific CVDs consistently increased following TC exposure, generally peaking around 2 months postexposure and dissipating by 6 months. Overall, each additional TC day was associated with a 13% (95% confidence interval, 7 to 19%) increase in CVD hospitalizations in 6 months following TCs. Particularly high TC-attributable burden was found for ischemic heart diseases and stroke, especially among males, individuals aged 20 to 59 years, and those with higher levels of socioeconomic deprivation. The TC-attributable proportions of CVD hospitalizations showed decreasing trends in less deprived populations and increasing trends in more deprived populations from 2000 to 2019.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-5">摘要</h3>
<p>Humanity stands at the threshold of a new era in biological understanding, disease treatment, and overall wellness. The convergence of evolving patient and caregiver (consumer) behaviors, increased data collection, advancements in health technology and standards, federal policies, and the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is driving one of the most significant transformations in human history. To achieve transformative health care insights, AI must have access to comprehensive longitudinal health records (LHRs) that span clinical, genomic, nonclinical, wearable, and patient-generated data. Despite the extensive use of electronic medical records and widespread interoperability efforts, current health care organizations, electronic medical record vendors, and public agencies are not incentivized to develop and maintain complete LHRs. This paper explores the new paradigm of consumers as the common provenance and singular custodian of LHRs. With fully aligned intentions and ample time to dedicate to optimizing their health outcomes, patients and caregivers must assume the sole responsibility to manage or delegate aggregation of complete, accurate, and real-time LHRs. Significant gaps persist in empowering consumers to act as primary custodians of their health data and to aggregate their complete LHRs, a foundational requirement for the effective application of AI. Rare disease communities, leaders in participatory care, offer a compelling model for demonstrating how consumer-driven data aggregation can be achieved and underscore the need for improved policy frameworks and technological tools. The convergence of AI and LHRs promises to transform medicine by enhancing clinical decision-making, accelerating accurate diagnoses, and dramatically advancing our ability to understand and treat disease at an unprecedented pace.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-6">摘要</h3>
<p>Vector-borne diseases pose significant global threats to both human and animal health, and their impacts are expected to intensify with ongoing climate change. Understanding the ecological and environmental drivers of these diseases is essential for developing effective surveillance and control strategies. Central to this is knowledge of the distributions of vectors and hosts, and how these may shift in response to environmental changes. In this study, we present a generalisable framework for predicting the current and future distributions of vectors and wildlife hosts using correlative modelling approaches. We integrate these predictions with data on livestock and human populations to inform the potential risk of West Nile virus (WNV) establishment and exposure in the United Kingdom. Currently absent from the United Kingdom, WNV is an orthoflavivirus maintained in a natural transmission cycle between mosquitoes and birds. Spillover into incidental hosts such as humans and horses can result in febrile illness, with severe cases leading to encephalitis and death. Our findings identify regions at elevated risk of WNV establishment where competent avian hosts and mosquito vectors are likely to co-occur and where infected vectors may interact with spillover hosts. We also explore how these risk patterns may evolve by 2100 under different environmental scenarios. Across all scenarios, risk is projected to increase in the south-east of the United Kingdom and decline in northern regions. This work demonstrates how modelling current and future vector and host distributions can inform risk assessments for emerging vector-borne diseases. Such insights are critical for guiding policy decisions and enhancing preparedness for disease incursions in a changing environment.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-7">摘要</h3>
<p>Variably protease-sensitive prionopathy (VPSPr) is a rare, atypical subtype of prion disease currently classified as sporadic. We performed exome sequencing and targeted sequencing of PRNP non-coding regions on genomic DNA from autopsy-confirmed VPSPr patients (N = 67) in order to search for a possible genetic cause. Our search identified no potentially causal variants for VPSPr. The common polymorphism PRNP M129V was the largest genetic risk factor for VPSPr, with an odds ratio of 7.0. Other variants in and near PRNP exhibited association to VPSPr risk only in proportion to their linkage disequilibrium with M129V, and upstream expression quantitative trait loci showed no evidence of independent association to VPSPr risk. We cannot rule out the possibility of causal variants hiding in genomic regions or classes of genetic variation that our search did not canvas. Nevertheless, our data support the classification of VPSPr as a sporadic prion disease.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-8">摘要</h3>
<p>Several antigen-detection assays have been developed for the rapid diagnosis of talaromycosis, but their utility has been limited by a lack of commercial options. The aim of this study was to perform a head-to-head comparison of the performance of our in-house monoclonal antibody-based Mp1p antigen-detecting enzyme immunoassay (EIA) with its recently-developed commercial platform.
In this diagnostic accuracy, retrospective, case-cohort study, we compared the sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (LR+) and negative likelihood ratio (LR-) of the commercial Wantai Mp1p EIA versus our in-house Mp1p EIA on paired plasma and urine samples from 424 hospitalized adults with advanced HIV disease, including 224 cases of proven talaromycosis, where Talaromyces marneffei was isolated in culture of blood or other clinical specimens, and 200 controls diagnosed with a range of other opportunistic infections. All participants were randomly selected from prospective cohorts recruited between 2011 and 2019 from five centers in Vietnam.
The sensitivity of the Wantai and in-house Mp1p EIAs were comparable in plasma (95.1% vs 92.4%, P = 0.11), in urine (91.5% vs 87.1% P = 0.07), and in combined testing of plasma and urine (96.4% vs 96.0%, P = 1.00), where talaromycosis was diagnosed based on the positivity of either specimen. The specificity of the Wantai and in-house Mp1p EIAs were consistently high in plasma, in urine, and in combined testing (93 - 97%). The Wantai and in-house Mp1p EIAs provided substantially higher sensitivity than blood culture detection (96.4% and 96.0% vs 78.6%, P &lt; 0.001). For both EIAs, LR+ were greater than 10 and LR- were less than 0.1, which increases the confidence to rule in or rule out talaromycosis.
The diagnostic performance of the Wantai Mp1p EIA was comparable to our validated in-house Mp1p EIA, and significantly more sensitive than blood culture, offering a standardized tool for the rapid diagnosis of talaromycosis.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-9">摘要</h3>
<p>Salmonella is one of the important pathogens causing acute gastroenteritis, and antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella raises a critical public health concern. Canals in Bangkok, Thailand, play a vital role as sources of agricultural and daily water usage. By employing whole genome sequencing to analyse 351 Salmonella genomes isolated between 2016 and 2020, we expanded the understanding of the characteristics and antimicrobial resistance properties of Salmonella enterica found in Bangkok canals, an underrepresented biome in research. Salmonella Agona was the dominant serotype, while S. Typhimurium and its monophasic variant were periodically found. Seven new sequence types (STs) were identified, including STs 11,346, 11,347, 11,348, 11,349, 11,350, 11,351, and 11,352. Seven chromosomal-mediated gene mutations and 50 antimicrobial resistance genes were detected. The three most common resistance genes were tet(A), blaTEM-1B, and qnrS1. The tet(X4) was first identified in the Salmonella population in Thailand, and mcr-3.1 was also detected. In total, 39.0% of the strains were potentially multidrug-resistant. The strains carried double amino acid substitutions in GyrA and ParC, and a strain with GyrA substitutions and qnrS1 exhibited the strongest resistance to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin. Most of the ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefotaxime-resistant strains (66.7%) harboured blaCTX-M-55. Col(pHAD28) was the predominant plasmid replicon type. Phylogenetic analysis of Salmonella STs 34 and 213 from canal water and the strains from databases showed the possibility of circulation of STs 34 and 213 between canal water and humans in Thailand and worldwide. These findings shed light on the circulation of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in the environmental water and advocate for incorporating environmental sampling into comprehensive AMR surveillance programmes within a One Health framework.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-10">摘要</h3>
<p>People who climb high altitudes frequently experience headaches, which are the primary symptoms of acute mountain sickness (AMS). While headaches and AMS are primarily caused by hypoxia, they remain poorly understood, specifically, the effects of regional cerebral blood flow on headache and AMS. In this high-altitude laboratory study, we investigated the hypothesis that regional cerebrovascular responses to high-altitude (3,776 m) sojourns are associated with AMS symptoms. The internal carotid artery (ICA), vertebral artery (VA), cardiorespiratory and vascular responses, and symptoms of AMS were assessed in eight healthy male lowlanders (mean age, 34 years) at sea level (SL, 450 m) and on three consecutive days at the summit of Mount Fuji (3,776 m). Compared to sea level, ICA flow increased on day 3 (P = 0.009) and ICA diameter increased on days 1 to 3 (P &lt;0.001). In contrast, VA flow increased on days 1 and 2 (P = 0.008 and P = 0.018) and VA velocity increased on day 1 (P = 0.044). Headaches increased over the 3 days (P = 0.011 to P = 0.048) but AMS increased on day 3 (P = 0.001). Repeated-measures correlation analysis revealed that changes in headaches from the previous day were correlated with percent changes in ICA diameter (rrm = 0.596, P = 0.012), VA flow and velocity (rrm = 0.537, P = 0.026; rrm = 0.619, P = 0.008). Thus, a high-altitude-induced increase in cerebrovascular perfusion may contribute to the worsening of headaches, which is a typical AMS pathogenesis.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-11">摘要</h3>
<p>Heavy metal toxicity is related with a number of diseases, but the problem increases when toxic metals are found in breast milk, the basic food item in a vulnerable age group. In this study, we assessed the levels of seven essential (i.e., Co, Cu, Mn, Mo, Se, Zn and V) and 13 toxic (i.e., Sb, As, Ba, Be, Cd, Cs, Pb, Hg, Ni, Pt, Th, Tl and U) metals in human milk of 118 lactating mothers who took part in a Spanish human biomonitoring project (BETTERMILK). The highest detection frequency (DF) was 100% for Cu, Zn, Se and Cs; 93% for As; and 84% for Hg. The rest of elements had DF below 40%. The geometric mean (GM) concentrations were below LoQ for 14 elements and the maximum level found was 2856 ng/g for Zn. The newborns’ estimated weekly/daily intake of toxic and essential metals through human milk was lower than their toxic reference values established by official organisms. To our knowledge, this is currently the first risk assessment study of infants to the most toxic metals such as Hg, As, Cd, Pb, Se and Zn through breast milk in Spain.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-12">摘要</h3>
<p>Theabrownins (TBs) are the major polyphenol-derived pigments and key bioactive components in dark tea formed through microbial fermentation or enzymatic oxidation. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the formation pathways, structural complexity, and diverse biological functions of TBs, highlighting recent advances in their production and application. Emerging evidence indicates that TBs exert significant health-promoting effects, including anti-obesity, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-cancer, anti-photodamage, and gut microbiota-modulating activities. These effects are mediated through multiple molecular mechanisms involving the regulation of bile acid metabolism, intestinal microbial composition, circadian rhythm genes, and signaling pathways such as AMPK/PGC1α, PI3K/Akt, FoxO/PPAR, FXR/FGF15, NRF2, and NF-κB. Additionally, TBs influence apoptosis, autophagy, and epigenetic modifications, thereby further contributing to their therapeutic potential. Despite promising bioactivities, challenges remain in elucidating TBs’ precise molecular structures, optimizing large-scale production, and translating findings from cell and animal studies into human clinical trials. Addressing these limitations is critical for advancing TBs from functional components to evidence-based nutraceutical ingredients. Overall, this review summarizes current knowledge on TBs’ bioactivities and underlying mechanisms. It also provides insights for future research and industrial development, supporting the potential of TBs as natural agents for disease prevention and human health promotion.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-13">摘要</h3>
<p>The National Blood Collection and Utilization Survey (NBCUS) is conducted biennially to estimate US blood collection and utilization. Supplemental data from the 2023 NBCUS not presented elsewhere are described here.
Data on blood donor characteristics, donation deferrals, component costs, transfusion-associated adverse reactions, and use of pathogen-reduced platelets during 2023 were collected from US blood collecting and transfusing facilities. National estimates were produced using weighting and imputation methods.
Compared with 2021, successful blood donations from donors aged 45-64 decreased (11%) in 2023 but still accounted for most donations overall (39%). Donations from donors aged 16-18 years, Black or African American, and Hispanic donors increased by 66%, 38%, and 9%, respectively, since 2021. Donation deferrals for travel increased since 2021 (+162%). From 2021 to 2023, the median price hospitals paid per unit of leukoreduced red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and leukoreduced and pathogen-reduced apheresis platelets increased. Apheresis platelets experienced the largest price increase per unit (+$65). Compared with 2021, the proportion of transfusing facilities using pathogen-reduced platelets increased in 2023 (60% vs. 64%). The overall rate of transfusion-associated adverse reactions per 100,000 components transfused was higher in 2023 than in 2021 (312.3 vs. 273.8), although the rate of transfusion-transmitted infections (bacterial, viral, and parasitic) declined in 2023 (0.25 vs. 0.43).
From 2021 to 2023, blood donations among older donors decreased, while donations from younger and Black or African American donors increased. Adoption of pathogen-reduced platelets and cost of all blood products increased.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-14">摘要</h3>
<p>Culicoides biting midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) are economically important biting flies known for transmitting pathogens like bluetongue virus to livestock. In order to control these insects and the diseases they are associated with, livestock producers employ a variety of preventive practices which commonly include insecticide use. The efficacy of insecticide treatments can wane over time as insects either develop resistance or the active ingredient is degraded in the environment. Sublethal insecticide exposures can change vector behaviour in ways that affect vectorial capacity. To determine whether Culicoides feeding behaviour is altered by sublethal exposure to commonly used agricultural insecticides, we exposed female C. sonorensis Wirth and Jones to permethrin and coumaphos at lethal concentrations (LC) ranging from LC10 to LC30. We also exposed midges to fluralaner at 100 mg/mL. Midges were offered a blood meal at 6, 12, 18 and 24 h post-exposure, and blood-feeding success was measured. We identified a significant inhibition of engorgement by permethrin up to 12 h post-exposure as well as by fluralaner up to 6 h post-exposure. Engorgement after coumaphos exposure was paradoxically higher in the LC30 group after 18 and 24 h post-exposure, but decreased at the same timepoints for the LC20 group. The different modes of action of each of these insecticides may account for their differing effects on Culicoides feeding.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-15">摘要</h3>
<p>In online health communities (OHCs), signaling theory has become a valuable framework for mitigating information asymmetry and shaping patient decisions. However, the literature remains fragmented, lacking an integrative understanding of how signals, signalers, receivers, and contexts interact to influence trust and engagement.
This study aimed to establish a comprehensive and integrative signaling framework tailored to OHCs. It sought to clarify the core constructs of signals, categorize different signal types, and examine how signaling dynamics contribute to managing medical information asymmetry. Furthermore, this study identified key research gaps and outlined future research directions to advance the theoretical and practical application of signaling theory in digital health contexts.
We conducted a systematic literature review using narrative synthesis techniques. A total of 80 peer-reviewed studies published between 2010 and 2024 were identified through 7 databases. These studies were analyzed and coded across 5 components of the signaling process: signalers, signals, receivers, signaling environments, and signaling mechanisms.
Five key findings emerged. First, OHC research is overwhelmingly signal centric-96% (77/80) of the studies focused on signal attributes, whereas only 3% (2/80) examined the characteristics of signalers and 14% (11/80) investigated receivers. This imbalance limits our understanding of how signals are produced and interpreted. Second, signaling mechanisms remain fragmented, with limited exploration of signal-signal or signal-context interactions. Only 31% (25/80) of the studies considered interactions between signals, and just 30% (24/80) examined contextual moderators such as uncertainty or competition. Third, environmental factors, especially environmental uncertainty and competition, play a central moderating role. Uncertain disease contexts or dense signal environments diminish signal effectiveness, particularly for affective signals. Fourth, signal classification in OHCs has become increasingly multidimensional. Signals can be systematically analyzed by their source (eg, internal vs third party), medium (eg, online vs offline), form (eg, taglike vs narrative), and affect (informative vs affective), enabling a more structured and theoretically consistent understanding. Fifth, signal interpretation is highly dependent on patient-level attributes. Patients with severe, chronic, or privacy-sensitive conditions prioritize competence or privacy signals, whereas those with limited health literacy rely more on simplified cues and affective heuristics.
This review advances signaling theory in digital health by providing a unified framework that connects structure and context. It highlights the underexplored roles of signalers and receivers, the importance of environmental moderation, and the cognitive-emotional duality of signals. These findings offer theoretical integration and practical value for improving platform trust, patient engagement, and decision-making in OHCs.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-16">摘要</h3>
<p>Objective: Transition-aged young adults (TAYA) with disabilities face high rates of unemployment and underemployment. Although assistive technology (AT) services can improve em-ployment outcomes in state vocational rehabilitation (VR) programs, they remain underutilized with notable disparities. This study examined how sociodemographic factors and their interactions predict the receipt of AT services for TAYA with disabilities. Methods: A retrospective analysis of national data collected by the Rehabilitation Service Administration’s Case Service Report from fiscal years 2017-2019 was conducted. The sample included 271,698 cases reporting a disability, aged 18-24, and eligible for VR services. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to examine the main and interaction effects of various sociodemographic variables on the likelihood of receiving AT services through VR programs. Results: Results indicated that less than 3% of TAYA with disabilities in the study sample received AT services. Characteristics associated with a lower likelihood of receiving AT services included being unemployed, from a minority group, having a significant disability, being older, having cognitive or mental health conditions, and not being enrolled in post-secondary education (PSE). Discussion and Conclusion: Findings suggest that AT services are underutilized, particularly for TAYA with cognitive and mental disabilities, those not enrolled in PSE, or those who are unemployed. These findings highlight the need for targeted efforts to enhance VR AT services to support employment transitions. Increasing AT training in rehabilitation educational programs and in-service training may improve service utilization. Future research should focus on evidence to support AT use in vocational settings and on developing guidelines for employment transitions.
Foster collaboration among VR personnel, local workforce centers, and educational institutions, including higher education and post-secondary personnel, to ensure clients receive the necessary ATsupport to achieve their educational and employment goals.Emphasize the importance of VR personnel having skills in individualized ATevaluation and implementation to meet the transition needs of each client they serve.Provide more ATtraining opportunities for in-service VR personnel to increase their competence in serving clients with ATservices, particularly those clients with cognitive and mental health conditions.Encourage VR personnel to adopt a team approach in delivering ATservices, especially for clients with significant disabilities who may face complex needs and more barriers to employment transitions.Recognize and address the limited access to ATservices faced by job seekers in state VR programs who are neither enrolled in the education system nor employed, particularly in addressing their job-seeking needs and transitions from education to employment.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-17">摘要</h3>
<p>Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent, widespread environmental contaminants and some are endocrine-disrupting. Studies of gynecologic cancers are limited; we evaluated ovarian cancer, a rare, often fatal malignancy.
This nested case-control study included 318 ovarian cancer cases and 472 individually matched female controls in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, which recruited participants aged 55-74 years from 10 U.S. study centers (1993-2001). We ascertained cases through 2016 and quantitated eight PFAS in prediagnostic serum samples. We estimated ORs and 95% CIs for continuous (log2-transformed) and categorized PFAS concentrations via conditional logistic regression models implicitly adjusting for matching factors (age, center, randomization year, year of blood draw, race and ethnicity) and adjusted for smoking, body mass index, family history of cancer, menopausal hormone therapy and oral contraceptive use, parity, and number of freeze-thaws.
We found a positive association with ovarian cancer for a doubling in 2-(N-methyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamido) acetic acid (MeFOSAA) concentrations (ORperlog2=1.24, CI = 1.03-1.49) and 62% greater risk among those in the highest quartile (ORQ4vsQ1=1.62, CI = 1.03-2.54; p-trend = 0.02). Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) was associated with increased risk (ORperlog2=1.47, CI = 1.05-2.06) with no quartile trend (p-trend = 0.79). Associations with perfluorononanoic (ORperlog2=1.36, CI = 0.95-1.95) and perfluorodecanoic acid (ORperlog2=1.35, CI = 0.94-1.95) were suggested, with non-monotonic quartile trends (p-trend = 0.12-0.21). MeFOSAA associations were strongest in women aged 55-59 (ORperlog2=1.60, CI = 1.13-2.27), more moderate in those 60-64 (ORperlog2=1.31, CI = 0.90-1.90) and null among women 65 + (ORperlog2=1.02, CI = 0.73-1.43; p-heterogeneity = 0.22). Associations persisted in cases diagnosed ≥8 years after blood collection.
These findings offer novel evidence for PFAS as ovarian cancer risk factors, particularly PFOS and MeFOSAA, a PFOS precursor.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-18">摘要</h3>
<p>This study aims to systematically characterize the genetic basis and intra-species differentiation of antibiotic resistance/virulence factor genes (ARGs/VFGs) in Enterobacter hormaechei subsp. xiangfangensis.
A high-quality metagenome-assembled genome of E. hormaechei subsp. xiangfangensis bin99 (97.22% completeness, 1.63% contamination) was acquired. Phylogenomic and average nucleotide identity (≥ 95%) analyses confirmed its taxonomic assignment. Pan-genomic analysis revealed an open configuration (Heap’s exponent B = 0.34) with a large accessory genome (approximate 2 965 genes) and a stabilized core genome (1 139 genes). Critically, a strong positive correlation (r = 0.86, P &lt; 2.2e-16) was observed between mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and accessory gene abundance, probably suggesting horizontal gene transfer (HGT) as a potential driver of genome diversity. Functional annotation highlighted distinct roles: core genes enriched in essential metabolism, while accessory/strain-specific genes were linked to adaptation. Screening identified significant inter-strain variation in ARGs (n = 31) and VFGs (n = 35). Bin99 itself harbored 19 ARGs (e.g. multidrug: soxS, ramA, oqxB) and 40 VFGs (e.g. flagella, T6SS). Importantly, MGE abundance showed a significant positive correlation with ARGs (r = 0.67, P &lt; 2.2e-16) but a negative correlation with VFGs (r = -0.29, P &lt; 3.7e-9), suggesting that ARGs were frequently linked to MGEs facilitating HGT-mediated spread, while VFGs might rely less on this route.
The findings provide genome-wide evidence for distinct genetic plasticity underlying ARG and VFG evolution in E. hormaechei subsp. xiangfangensis, highlighting implications for resistance and virulence dissemination.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-19">摘要</h3>
<p>Alcohol withdrawal is a common emergency department (ED) presentation, but differences in long-term outcomes between female and male patients are not clear.
From January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2018, at three urban EDs in Vancouver, British Columbia, we studied patients who were discharged with a primary or secondary diagnosis of alcohol withdrawal. We performed a structured chart review to ascertain patient characteristics and ED treatments. We linked with regional ED and provincial data to obtain the outcomes of 1-year return ED visits and mortality, respectively. The primary outcome was at least one return visit to the ED, and secondary outcomes included ED revisits and 1-week, 1-month, and 1-year mortality. We compared female patients with male patients using descriptive methods.
We identified 1,019 unique patients with 273 (26.8%) female. Median ages, ambulance arrival, initial withdrawal severity score, and index visit admission rates were similar. At 1 year, 186 (68.1%) female and 515 (69.0%) male patients reattended an ED, for a difference of 0.9%; (95% CI - 5.5 to 7.7%). A significantly greater proportion of male patients reattended at 1 week and 1 month, and the average number of male ED revisits was greater at 1 week, 1 month, and 1 year. By 1 year, a female patient (0.4%) and 19 males (2.6%) died, for a difference of 2.2% (95% CI 0.3-3.6%).
Despite similar ED presentations, female patients with alcohol withdrawal had fewer 1-year ED visits and lower mortality. EDs may wish to incorporate sex-specific approaches to post-discharge management.
RéSUMé: CONTEXTE: Le sevrage alcoolique est une présentation courante dans les services d’urgence (SU), mais les différences dans les résultats à long terme entre les patients féminins et masculins ne sont pas claires. MéTHODES: Du 1er janvier 2015 au 31 décembre 2018, nous avons étudié des patients qui avaient reçu un diagnostic primaire ou secondaire de sevrage d’alcool à leur congé dans trois SE urbains de Vancouver (Colombie-Britannique). Nous avons effectué une revue structurée du dossier pour déterminer les caractéristiques des patients et les traitements ED. Nous avons établi un lien avec les données régionales et provinciales sur le DE pour obtenir les résultats des visites du DE d’une année et la mortalité, respectivement. Le résultat principal était au moins une visite de retour à l’ED, et les résultats secondaires incluaient des visites de l’ED et une mortalité d’une semaine et d’un mois, ainsi qu’une mortalité d’un an. Nous avons comparé les patients féminins avec les patients masculins en utilisant des méthodes descriptives. RéSULTATS: Nous avons identifié 1019 patients uniques avec 273 (26,8 %) femmes. L’âge médian, l’arrivée en ambulance, le score de gravité du sevrage initial et les taux d’admission aux visites indexées étaient similaires. À un an, 186 (68,1 %) patientes et 515 (69,0 %) patients de sexe masculin ont repris leur service d’urgence, pour une différence de 0,9 %; (IC à 95 % -5,5 à 7,7 %) Une proportion significativement plus grande de patients de sexe masculin a repris leur service après une semaine et un mois, et le nombre moyen de services d’urgence revisés par des hommes était plus élevé à une semaine, un mois, et une année. Après un an, une patiente (0,4 %) et 19 hommes (2,6 %) sont décédés, pour une différence de 2,2 % (IC à 95 % 0,3 à 3,6 %). CONCLUSIONS: Malgré des présentations similaires de la DE, les patientes ayant un sevrage d’alcool ont eu moins de visites à la DE pour un an et une mortalité plus faible. Les PE pourraient souhaiter intégrer des approches propres à chaque sexe dans la gestion après la libération.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-20">摘要</h3>
<p>This manuscript provides a comprehensive review of the risks of radiation exposure in endourology and highlights strategies to ensure the health and safety of endourologists during pregnancy.
Recent studies have measured radiation exposure to endourologists during fluoroscopic procedures, underscoring the role of protective measures such as lead shielding, low-dose fluoroscopy, and pulsed imaging to significantly reduce radiation doses. Adherence to these strategies enables endourologists to safely perform fluoroscopic procedures throughout pregnancy while staying within recommended exposure limits. This review outlines the latest research on radiation exposure in endourology with a focus on exposure risks during pregnancy. Major findings include insights into potential stochastic and dose-dependent effects of radiation exposure on pregnant endourologists and their fetuses as well as effective dose-reduction strategies to mitigate these risks. Further research is needed to improve individual understanding of exposure risks and establish standardized institutional and policy frameworks for radiation safety during pregnancy.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-21">摘要</h3>
<p>To explore the facilitators and barriers to community accessibility from the perspective of persons with lower limb amputation (LLA).
A qualitative study using an adapted version of the Photovoice methods described by Wang and Burris was undertaken. Analysis of the interviews and photos was conducted following thematic content analysis.
Seven adults with LLA who were ambulating with a prosthesis at the time of the interview participated in the Photovoice interviews. From the interviews with the participants, 3 main themes were developed: (1) current state of accessibility, (2) impact of community inaccessibility, and (3) hope for the future. Participants described what accessibility currently involved in their community (eg, the positive and negative structures) as well as the impact of inaccessibility on their physical and emotional health. Participants also spoke about what improvements they would like to see in the future regarding community accessibility.
By using the Photovoice methods, participants were able to provide tangible examples of what influences their community accessibility. This study highlights the broad range of changes that could provide accessibility opportunities for individuals with LLA from simple changes (eg, adding handrails to arenas) to more complex changes (eg, improvements in parking lot accessibility).</p>

<h3 id="摘要-22">摘要</h3>
<p>Aluminum (Al) is a widespread environmental contaminant with suspected links to neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the association between environmental Al exposure and the risk of AD by synthesizing evidence from diverse sources and study designs. A systematic review was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Literature searches were performed in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, and the gray literature up to June 2024. After duplicate removal and screening of 6504 records, 54 eligible studies on Al exposure and dementia/AD were included. Data extraction focused on exposure media, Al concentrations, Al and AD/dementia correlation, and geographic context. Screening was independently conducted by two reviewers, with good inter-rater reliability (Kappa = 0.75). Meta-analysis was conducted on the studies that reported sufficient quantitative data, using Hedges’ g to estimate the effect size of Al exposure on AD. The included studies demonstrated considerable spatial and temporal variation. Of the 54 studies, 26 reported a positive association between Al exposure and AD or dementia, while 24 found no or negative associations. Major exposure sources included contaminated water, soil, diet, occupational settings, and medical interventions. Although few studies confirmed Al-induced brain pathology as a direct cause of dementia, meta-analysis of four eligible studies revealed a strong association between Al exposure and AD (Hedges’ g = 2.451), despite high heterogeneity across data sources and outcome measures. Our findings suggest that environmental Al exposure may contribute to the development of AD, though it is likely one of several interacting risk factors. Environmental conditions appear to influence both Al bioaccumulation and its neurotoxic effects related to cognitive decline.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-23">摘要</h3>
<p>The relationship between residential greenness and chronic vascular diseases (VD) remains inconclusive. This study aimed to assess the associations between residential greenness and the incidence of new-onset VD. We analyzed data from a cohort of up to 240,000 participants without prior VD. To investigate the associations between residential greenness and the incidence of VD, we employed Cox proportional hazard models alongside restricted cubic spline regression. Greenness encompassed green space, domestic garden, and natural environment, while VD included eight specific conditions, such as heart failure, sequelae of cerebrovascular disease (CeVD), and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). Participants were stratified according to their exposure levels of residential greenness, with the lowest level serving as the reference group. Over a median follow-up of 10.8 years, more than 30,000 participants developed VD. Green space and natural environment were associated with a decreased VD risk, with green space showing the strongest effect on sequelae of CeVD (HR = 0.662, 95 %CI: 0.556-0.789), followed by natural environment on PVD (0.738, 0.667-0.815). In contrast, domestic garden was correlated with an increased VD risk, such as sequelae of CeVD (1.252, 1.079-1.453) and PVD (1.141, 1.050-1.239). Furthermore, stratified analyses revealed that the protective associations of residential greenness were particularly pronounced for heart failure among obesity individuals, males, and those who consume alcohol. Our findings suggest that exposure to green space and natural environment was negatively associated with VD risk. These results may underscore the potential role of residential greenness in regulating VD risk.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-24">摘要</h3>
<p>To identify perceived barriers and facilitators to an intended adoption of aconsensus-based same-day discharge (SDD) clinical guideline for patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
This qualitative study was conducted in six cardiac catheterisation suites of public hospitals in Queensland, Australia. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with clinicians, patients, and carers between July and October 2024. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. Inductive content analysis was performed before themes were mapped deductively against the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF).
A total of 22 participants (doctors [n = 10], nurses [n = 8], patients [n = 2], and carers [n = 2]) participated in interviews. Six domains, including knowledge, social/professional role and identity, environmental contexts and resources, beliefs about consequences, memory, attention, and decision-making, and beliefs about capabilities, were strongly related to the factors that influenced the implementation. The findings revealed perceived main barriers to the implementation, including logistical (e.g., geographical considerations), professional (e.g., resistance to change), and hospital reimbursement models that unfavoured SDD. The main drivers were effective leadership, benchmarking among hospitals, inter-hospital consultation and collaboration, having a designated champion, and targeted education sessions for clinicians, patients, and carers.
Findings suggest that adopting this consensus-based SDD clinical guideline has multifactorial and interrelated influences. The identification of the barriers across various TDF domains provides opportunities to develop effective implementation strategies to facilitate SDD implementation.
This study highlights the need for multifaceted approach to implementing SDD. Leaders in public health policy and organisations must consider a range of interconnected influences for effective implementation and sustained adherence.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-25">摘要</h3>
<p>To evaluate and compare the efficacy of nonpharmacological interventions on sleep-wake states among preterm infants in NICUs through a network meta-analysis (NMA).
This study conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis. A systematic search of the PubMed, Embase, ProQuest, and CINAHL databases was conducted from inception to September 11, 2024. The NMA included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of nonpharmacological interventions on sleep disturbances in preterm infants (aged &lt; 37 weeks) in NICUs. Data were independently extracted and analyzed by two reviewers using a random-effects model. The risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane’s RoB 2.0 tool. Strength of evidence was assessed using the Confidence in NMA tool.
Seventeen RCTs involving 709 preterm infants and 11 interventions were included. Touch and massage combined with kangaroo care (T + M + KC) most effectively improved the proportion of time spent in the active (20.41 %; 95 % confidence interval = 0.06-40.77) and quiet (8.33 %; 95 % confidence interval = 3.97-12.69) sleep phases compared with standard care. The P-score analysis supported this finding, revealing that T + M + KC was the most likely to be the optimal nonpharmacological treatment for both active (96 %) and quiet (94 %) sleep, followed by NIDCAP, which ranked second for active (83 %) and quiet (73 %) sleep. Most studies (64.7 %) demonstrated a low risk of bias, and most comparisons across sleep-wake states received a high confidence rating.
T + M + KC was the most effective, cost-efficient, and noninvasive intervention for improving sleep in preterm infants. Future large-scale, high-quality RCTs are necessary to confirm these findings and evaluate long-term outcomes.
T + M + KC represents a safe, cost-effective, and noninvasive intervention that can be feasibly implemented in NICUs to improve sleep outcomes in preterm infants. Training NICU staff to apply multimodal, sensory-based care can enhance neurodevelopmental outcomes and reduce sleep disruptions, ultimately supporting healthier growth trajectories in this vulnerable population.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-26">摘要</h3>
<p>Building on our previous theory-guided research findings, this study investigated differences in COVID-19 vaccination-related beliefs across a number of relevant types of communication such as provider recommendations and aided recall of various vaccination campaign assets. We also explored the potential roles of political affiliation and social vulnerability in vaccination beliefs.
A cross-sectional survey of West Virginia residents was administered in January 2022 online and via phone interview by Research America, Inc. (N = 756).
About 71 % of respondents had received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose at the time of the survey. Two-thirds of the sample reported having a healthcare provider recommend vaccination, and around two-thirds reported seeing a vaccination TV advertisement. Despite varying strength of beliefs across political groups, there was a general openness to choosing to vaccinate against the virus that causes COVID-19 , which reflects a social landscape conducive to vaccination communication and points toward the importance of understanding unique population segment needs, wants, and reservations, as well as the messengers from whom they trust to receive such information. Healthcare provider recommendation was consistently associated with stronger vaccination-related intentions and beliefs. Most observed differences in vaccine-related beliefs were between those who reported being politically liberal compared to both those who reported being politically moderate and politically conservative. Politically moderate and conservative participants, however, did not vary from one another. Social vulnerability index was mostly unrelated to vaccination beliefs.
Participants had overall relatively supportive vaccination-related beliefs. While partisanship played some role surrounding vaccination-related beliefs, even politically conservative groups still exhibited positive attitudes and intentions toward vaccination- albeit to a lesser degree than their liberal counterparts. The social landscape was at least conducive to vaccination communication. Findings build on previous theory-driven communication science scholarship and hold practical implications for communication messengers and channels for ongoing health communication in a rural Appalachia.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-27">摘要</h3>
<p>In May 2024, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil faced severe flooding, disrupting essential health services. This study assessed the impact of these floods on vaccination coverage rates in affected municipalities.
This ecological study analyzed vaccination data from all 497 municipalities in Rio Grande do Sul (January-December 2024), including the entire eligible population of children scheduled for three routine vaccines (pentavalent, measles-mumps-rubella, and hepatitis A). Municipalities were classified by official calamity status (78 with calamity, 419 without). Linear regression analysis compared vaccination coverage across pre-flood (January-April), flood (May), and post-flood (June-September) periods.
The study included 111,973 children, representing the complete target population for vaccination in the state. Annual mean coverage was 93.44 %, with significant differences between calamity (90.33 %) and non-calamity municipalities (96.29 %; p &lt; 0.001). During May, coverage decreased dramatically, particularly in calamity areas (63.05 % vs 77.74 %, p &lt; 0.001), representing a 26.58 percentage-point reduction from pre-flood levels compared to 17.78 points in other areas. By June-September, coverage returned to pre-disaster levels, though geographic disparities persisted.
This analysis demonstrates the immediate negative impact of flooding on childhood immunization, particularly in calamity-declared areas, while highlighting vaccination system recovery capacity. Findings emphasize the need for specific immunization strategies in disaster response planning during climate emergencies.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-28">摘要</h3>
<p>This study aims to assess the trends and influencing factors in post-vaccination serologic testing (PVST) completion rates among infants born to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive mothers using real-world data, providing insights to guide future PVST strategy implementation.
Data were obtained from the case records of HBsAg-positive pregnant women and their newborns in Guangdong Province from January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2023. The Cochran-Armitage test was used to analyze trends in PVST completion rates and the age distribution of infants completing PVST, among HBV-exposed neonates, stratified by birth weight, from 2021 to 2023. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify factors influencing PVST completion rates.
Our PVST study analyzed data from 159,629 HBsAg-positive pregnant women and their newborns from 2021 to 2023. PVST completion rate increased from 74.44 % to 82.44 % in infants weighing &lt;2000 g and from 81.96 % to 88.01 % in infants weighing ≥2000 g. A greater number of infants completed PVST at the 7-9 months of age, with proportions rising from 14.52 % to 44.04 % among infants weighing &lt;2000 g and from 31.99 % to 51.91 % among those weighing ≥2000 g. Factors that positively influenced PVST completion rates included higher birth weight, older maternal age, receipt of antiviral treatment during pregnancy, higher maternal education level, infant at high risk for HBV infection.
This study highlights showing significant improvements in PVST completion rates among HBV-exposed infants from 2021 to 2023. Additionally, the proportion of infants completing PVST at 7-9 months of age increased substantially during this period. These findings highlight the progress made in improving PVST adherence and underscore the importance of targeted interventions to further enhance compliance among at-risk populations.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-29">摘要</h3>
<p>Vaccinations significantly reduce the incidence of preventable diseases. Despite their benefits, childhood vaccination rates have declined in Italy since the mid-2010s, prompting the government to mandate certain vaccinations. This cross-sectional study aims to assess the intention to vaccinate their children and the perception of mandatory vaccinations among pregnant women in Italy after the COVID-19 pandemic and post-mandatory vaccination policies.
Participants over 18 years old recruited from 18 cities in Italy completed a questionnaire covering socio-demographic information, vaccination intentions, sources of information, and trust in vaccinations and the healthcare system. Descriptive analyses of the intention to vaccinate their children were carried out, and logistic regressions were performed to identify predictors of being in favor of mandatory vaccinations.
Out of 2472 women, 98.8 % intended to vaccinate their upcoming children. High intentions were reported for rubella (91.7 %), measles (91.0 %), hepatitis B (90.4 %), and pertussis (90.4 %), while only 30.3 % intended to vaccinate against COVID-19. Healthcare professionals were the most trusted source of information. A total of 89.1 % of the women were in favor of mandatory vaccinations. Multivariable regression indicated that higher knowledge, risk perception, and trust scores were significant predictors of support for mandatory vaccinations.
These findings highlight the crucial role of healthcare professionals in shaping positive vaccination intentions, providing valuable insights for policymakers seeking to enhance vaccination coverage in the post-pandemic era.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-30">摘要</h3>
<p>When voters passed the 2020 Ballot Measure 110 (M110), the U.S. State of Oregon changed course from a criminal legal system response to a health-centered approach to substance use. M110 was passed with the goal of making health assessment screenings, treatment, and recovery services for substance use disorder available to all who need them and reduce the harms associated with involving the criminal legal system for people who use drugs. Although drug decriminalization was enacted in February 2021, most of M110’s funding streams for substance use disorder treatment, harm reduction, and housing assistance were delayed until August 2022. In the absence of health- or treatment-related data, preliminary studies used pre- and post-crime trend data to show that possession of controlled substances arrests decreased after Oregon implemented drug decriminalization. The goal of this methods piece is to inform researchers and governments about the nuances of crime data when these data are often the only means available to assess a new drug policy. Given the multiple factors that occurred immediately before or contemporaneous to enactment of M110 (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic, Oregon’s acute affordable housing shortage), we consider the methodological issues of prematurely attempting to answer research questions using available crime trend data and associated analytic models to make determinations about whether M110 was meeting its intended goals. Patience and time are needed for ensuring that the necessary and appropriate data are available that correspond to policy goals. We include recommendations for future analyses when more robust data are available to holistically assess the impacts of drug policies.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-31">摘要</h3>
<p>Despite its prevalence and potential consequences, sibling violence often stays under the radar in professional health care, social and judicial services. The lack of awareness and training related to sibling violence has led to failing to detect and properly address it.
The main goals of this study are to investigate how youth care professionals in social and judicial services address physical and psychological sibling violence, what challenges they encounter while trying to address it, and their thoughts on needed changes to practice and policy to reduce sibling violence. The study expands current knowledge of evidence-based practice approaches which are generally limited to social work and school counseling, by including youth care professionals in social and judicial services.
Youth care professionals in social and judicial services (n = 13) in Flanders (Belgium) were selected based on their experience addressing child abuse and neglect.
In-depth interviews and focus groups were conducted, transcribed and coded using initial, pattern and selective coding methods.
Consistent with previous literature, results indicate a lack of awareness of sibling violence in Flemish social and judicial youth care services. Professionals consistently expressed the need for greater awareness about sibling violence and tools to respond to it adequately. They prioritized a social service response characterized by a family-oriented approach rather than a judicial response.
Professionals need information on typical sibling dynamics and signs and impacts of sibling violence and evidence-based tools to effectively address it. Given the prevalence and impacts of sibling violence, the development of evidence-based training and family-oriented prevention and intervention efforts are critical to reduce it, but such efforts are limited by professionals’ capacity, funding, and time.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-32">摘要</h3>
<p>The World Health Organization recommends that cancer survivors maintain a healthy diet and weight control to prevent cancer recurrence. Albeit a growing interest in using mobile apps for health promotion, there is a need for comprehensive evidence on the effects of mobile apps, particularly on dietary behaviors.
This study aims to evaluate the efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability of mobile app-based dietary interventions among cancer survivors and explore the potential mobile app features worth incorporating.
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Embase, Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Web of Science from inception to September 2023 without language restriction. We identified studies that used mobile apps for dietary interventions as a major module for cancer survivors. In addition, 2 independent reviewers screened the studies, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality using Cochrane’s risk of bias tools for randomized trials (RoB 2) and nonrandomized studies (ROBINS-I). A meta-analysis was conducted on body weight, BMI, nutritional outcomes, and quality of life using random-effects models.
Of the 2621 records identified, 22 studies involving 1204 cancer survivors were included. Notably, existing trials involved only breast and gastrointestinal cancer survivors. Preliminary evidence suggested that mobile app-based dietary interventions demonstrated a beneficial effect on energy intake (Hedges g=1.00, 95% CI 0.96-1.03) and weight changes (Hedges g=-0.43, 95% CI -0.45 to -0.41); as well as a potential to improve protein intake and quality of life among gastrointestinal cancer survivors. The usability, quality, and satisfaction of app use as measured by standardized questionnaires, including the System Usability Scale, the Mobile Application Rating Scale, and the Questionnaire for User Interface Satisfaction, were positive. While feedback messages and dietary goal setting were considered facilitators of mobile app use, concerns regarding the time required for app use and limited food logging options were raised.
Our review found the preliminary efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability of mobile app-based dietary interventions for cancer survivors. However, study heterogeneity should be recognized. More trials are warranted to confirm the effectiveness of these interventions and explore any differences based on cancer types, staging, treatment statuses, the mode of communication with dietitians, and the engagement of family or caregivers. Existing mobile apps could maintain important features such as feedback messages and dietary goal setting while considering the incorporation of artificial intelligence-powered food recognition in food logging and cancer-specific dietary recommendations.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-33">摘要</h3>
<p>Several guidelines recommend that systemic therapies involving tocilizumab, baricitinib, and corticosteroids are crucial in treating severely and critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the efficacy of the tocilizumab and corticosteroid combination compared with the baricitinib and corticosteroid combination in severely and critically ill hospitalized patients with COVID-19 remains unclear.
We analyzed severely and critically ill hospitalized patients with COVID-19 aged ≥18 years between 1 January 2020 and 31 March 2023 using a Japanese inpatient database. Propensity score matching was performed to compare the effects of the tocilizumab plus corticosteroid and baricitinib plus corticosteroid combinations (tocilizumab and baricitinib groups, respectively) within 2 days of hospitalization on the in-hospital mortality rate related to COVID-19.
Of the 197,507 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in our database, those eligible were divided into the tocilizumab and baricitinib groups (n = 244 and 665, respectively). The one-to-one propensity score-matching analysis created 198 pairs. Before propensity score matching, the in-hospital mortality rate related to COVID-19 was higher in the tocilizumab group than in the baricitinib group (20.5 % vs. 9.0 %, P &lt; 0.001). In contrast, after propensity score matching, no significant intergroup difference was observed in the in-hospital mortality rate related to COVID-19 (16.7 % vs. 11.1 %, P = 0.143).
This observational study showed that the tocilizumab and corticosteroid combination did not reduce in-hospital mortality rates in severely and critically ill patients with COVID-19 compared with the baricitinib and corticosteroid combination.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-34">摘要</h3>
<p>The reduced life expectancy observed in individuals with schizophrenia (SCZ) underscores the urgent need for novel therapeutic targets. Emerging evidence suggests that astrocytic dysfunction and immune-inflammatory processes contribute to SCZ pathophysiology. Low-dose methotrexate (MTX), an established immunomodulatory drug used for non-neurological conditions, demonstrated antipsychotic potential in early SCZ. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown.
This study aimed to identify molecular targets of MTX within SCZ-relevant pathways, focusing on astrocytic and neuroimmune networks using in silico bioinformatics analysis and a rodent model for SCZ.
In silico analysis: A bioinformatics-based approach was employed, integrating cognitive computing-generated knowledge graphs, modular co-expression analysis, and gene-drug interaction databases with a machine learning-based text-mining tool. Rodent model: The NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801-induced mouse model for SCZ was used to assess MTX’s therapeutic potential, compared to clozapine. Behavioural outcomes (sociability and cognition) and astrocytic reactivity (GFAP expression in the medial prefrontal cortex, mPFC) were evaluated.
In silico: MTX preferentially targeted hub genes within astrocyte and NFκB modules. In astrocytes, MTX modulated NT5E, a key regulator of adenosine metabolism. In the NFκB module, MTX interacted with IL-6 and STAT3, both involved in immune regulation. Rodent model: MK-801 administration impaired sociability and cognition, accompanied by increased GFAP-positive astrocytes in the prelimbic mPFC, both of which were prevented by MTX. The neuroimmunomodulator effect of MTX was comparable to clozapine in both the in silico and rodent model.
Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the potential antipsychotic-like effects of low-dose MTX in SCZ, involving astrocytic modulation and immune regulation. Further experimental medicine studies in clinical populations stratified by astrocytic and neuroinflammatory biomarkers are warranted to validate these findings.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-35">摘要</h3>
<p>PM2.5, a complex and toxic environmental pollutant, poses a significant threat to animal lung health. Competitive endogenous ribonucleic acids (ceRNAs) serve as a crucial regulatory mechanism for tissue damage and apoptosis and are intimately associated with the toxicity mechanism of PM2.5. However, the specific mechanism of ceRNA in lung injury and apoptosis induced by PM2.5 in cow barns remains to be fully elucidated. To address this knowledge gap, an in vivo model of rats exposed to PM2.5 in cow barns and an in vitro model of cell injury were developed. The study identified differentially expressed Lnc-H3f3b2 and constructed the LncR-H3f3b2/miR-122-5p/RASSF2 regulatory network using a dual luciferase reporter gene. The results of this study demonstrated that exposure to PM2.5 led to tissue damage and a reduction in cell viability. Furthermore, the study revealed that RASSF2 overexpression could inhibit apoptosis and that lncRNA could upregulate RASSF2 levels, thereby alleviating apoptosis. This study is the first to demonstrate that this regulatory axis affects cattle lung injury induced by PM2.5 and the mechanisms of apoptosis.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-36">摘要</h3>
<p>The reduction, refinement, and replacement of animal-based toxicological studies is becoming an essential requirement at academic, industrial, and governmental levels, turning new approach methodologies (NAMs) from alternatives into necessities. New strategies for hazard characterization and exposure assessment have been developed in this wake, including among others, sophisticated organ-on-chip platforms, or holistic human biomonitoring programs. This review summarizes state-of-the-art methods of NAMs for hazard characterization and advances in exposure assessment in the context of toxicants occurring in human urine. Considering that urine collects a wide variety of excretion products, it can harbor chemically diverse compounds including heavy metals and metalloids, foodborne mycotoxins and phytotoxins, as well as synthetic and process chemicals. Hence, urine analysis is a precious element for exposure assessment and the urinary excretory organs are highly relevant toxicological targets. Especially for environmental or foodborne contaminants, the classical regulatory framework is challenged by natural variability of the producing organisms, climate change, global trade, and obviously heterogeneous exposure landscape related to an individual’s lifestyle and diet. In this light, NAMs represent an unprecedented opportunity to support and speed up risk assessment. The aim of this review is to summarize current knowledge, in order to identify gaps on hazard profiling for selected urinary occurring contaminants, as well as for their exposure assessment. Furthermore, it aims at identifying the challenges in the field from both the toxicological and analytical perspectives in light of next generation risk assessment (NGRA).</p>

<h3 id="摘要-37">摘要</h3>
<p>Mercury (Hg) is an environmental concern in polar regions, including Antarctica-despite its remoteness and limited direct human activity. This review examines Hg exposure and the potential health risks for 31 species of Antarctic seabirds, using Hg toxicity benchmarks established for blood and converted for feathers. Blood and feathers Hg concentrations differed among families, species and diet. Squid-feeding species, such as albatrosses and some petrels, exhibited the greatest Hg concentrations, while crustacean feeders, such as Pygoscelis species, showed the lowest concentrations. Several Antarctic seabird populations showed blood Hg levels exceeding known toxicity thresholds, with 62 % of species surpassing the “no adverse health effect” level. Furthermore, 25 % of the species reviewed were categorized as being at moderate to high risk of Hg toxicity. While the majority (70 %) were considered at no or low risk, even relatively low Hg levels have been associated with adverse outcomes, including reduced egg volume and lower breeding success. Comparisons with Arctic seabirds of similar diets suggest comparable Hg burdens. Although overall Hg contamination in Antarctic seabirds remains low for most species, the potential for harmful effects may be amplified when combined with other stressors such as pollutants, disease, parasites, and climate change. This review also underscores a significant gap in available data: most existing studies are limited to a few species, locations, or isolated sampling years. Addressing these gaps will require broader, long-term monitoring efforts and international collaboration to improve understanding of Hg exposure and its ecological impacts in Antarctic seabird populations.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-38">摘要</h3>
<p>Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive condition caused by a deficiency of the phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme, leading to severe cognitive and physical impairments if untreated. Early diagnosis through newborn screening and adherence to a strict diet can mitigate symptoms, but challenges remain for patients and families, including emotional and financial burdens. The study aims to assess the health-related quality of life of Jordanian adolescents with PKU.
A cross-sectional study conducted in October 2024 at the sole PKU clinic in Jordan examined adolescents aged 12 to 18 with varying degrees of PKU severity. Non-Jordanian patients receiving care at the center were excluded, as were those whose parents reported an inability to comprehend the study instrument. Among 54 identified adolescents, 32 met the eligibility criteria. The study utilized the Arabic version of the PKU-QoL questionnaire to evaluate health-related quality of life, concentrating on four domains (social, emotional, practical and overall).
A total of 32 adolescents diagnosed with PKU participated in the study. The most frequently reported symptoms were slow thinking and lack of concentration. The emotional domain was the most affected (Mean = 52.81 ± 20.32), whereas the social domain was the least affected (Mean = 26.04 ± 17.16).
Adolescents with PKU maintain a good health-related quality of life despite facing emotional challenges, indicating a need for emotional support. Although improvements have been made through screening programs and dietary resources, financial challenges remain, highlighting the necessity for specialized treatment centers and affordable low-protein foods.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-39">摘要</h3>
<p>Neospora caninum is an intracellular protozoan that is the causative agent of neosporosis, a disease relevant to the veterinary field for causing neuromuscular disease in dogs and repeated abortions in ruminants. In the present moment, there are no therapies that are able to induce sterile cure against the infection and prevention strategies rely only in environmental management. In this context, we aimed to determine the protective role of the Interferon alpha and beta receptor (IFNAR) during an experimental infection with N. caninum. We performed in vivo experiments with genetically deficient mice (Ifnar-/-). Those mice, in direct comparison with wildtype (WT) controls, presented reduced survival against the infection, associated with increased parasite load and inflammation in different tissues. In agreement, we observed that the absence of the IFN-I receptor led to a significant reduction in crucial inflammatory mediators that control the infection, namely IL-12, IFN-γ and nitric oxide. Together, our results showed that IFNAR is a central molecule that mediates host resistance against N. caninum by controlling acute and chronic parasite replication, through the induction of an effective Th1 immune response against this protozoan parasite.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-40">摘要</h3>
<p>The CRISPR/Cas12a system is extensively employed for nucleic acid detection, where crRNA is typically administered in excess to quantify target levels. However, its non-specific trans-cleavage activity poses challenges for achieving multiplexed detection within a single-pot CRISPR/Cas12a assay. In this study, we introduce a crRNA-limited strategy for multiplexed detection based on the CRISPR/Cas12a system, termed cliCRISPR. This approach correlates fluorescence intensity with crRNA concentration rather than target concentration. By precisely controlling crRNA concentrations, distinct low, medium, and high fluorescence intensities can be observed for multiple targets. As proof of concept, distinguishable fluorescence intensities for wild-type, mutant, and heterozygous genotypes of rs4646536 which is associated with vitamin D deficiency could be obtained with 10 nM crRNA1 and 3 nM crRNA2. Subsequently, a logic-gate strategy is utilized for rs4646536 genotyping by comparing fluorescence intensity slope with the cut-off values (V0 = 25.96, V1 = 40.16 and V2 = 1815.56). To validate the practicability, the proposed cliCRISPR method was applied to genotype rs4646536 for 10 samples from 2 families. The results were consistent with those obtained using TaqMan qPCR and adhered to Mendel’s laws of inheritance. Therefore, cliCRISPR demonstrates potential for developing multiplexed biosensors based on the CRISPR/Cas12a system.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-41">摘要</h3>
<p>The identification of high-grade patterns and mucinous features of invasive primary lung adenocarcinoma on biopsy specimens can have implications on therapeutic decisions across all stages of disease. Shape sensing robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (ssRAB) is an emerging modality for the concomitant diagnosis and staging of lung cancer. We evaluated the performance of ssRAB for adenocarcinoma pattern identification, and particularly high-grade patterns, as well as the histopathologic concordance between biopsy and surgical resection specimens.
Patients with lung adenocarcinoma diagnosed via ssRAB forceps or cryobiopsy specimens between October 2019 and December 2023 were included in the analysis. Biopsy specimens were evaluated for the identification of histopathologic patterns and mucinous features. A generalized linear mixed model quantified the association between pre- and intra-operative factors and successful pattern identification on biopsy. The concordance between high-grade patterns and mucinous features on ssRAB-acquired biopsy and poorly differentiated grade and mucinous features on subsequent surgical resection was determined.
A total of 242 ssRAB-acquired specimens were included in the final analysis. The biopsy specimen was sufficient to identify adenocarcinoma histopathologic patterns in 71 %. In a multivariable analysis, sampling by cryobiopsy was positively associated with pattern identification (OR 3.54, CI: 1.02-12.30; P = 0.04), as compared with forceps biopsy. A corresponding surgical resection specimen was available in 66 cases. The sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values of biopsy were 63, 72, 61, and 74 %, respectively for the presurgical detection of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, and 87, 100, 100, and 96 %, respectively for the presurgical detection of mucinous features.
This study is the first to report the performance of ssRAB-acquired biopsy for identification of adenocarcinoma patterns and its concordance with surgical resection. Our findings align with those previously reported for percutaneous lung biopsy. ssRAB emerges as a viable tool for the identification of adenocarcinoma patterns. Future studies are needed to confirm these findings in larger patient cohorts.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-42">摘要</h3>
<p>Vibrio parahaemolyticus, a significant seafood-borne pathogen, necessitates rapid and precise detection to guarantee food safety. Herein, we developed a visualization assay method by engineering T4 bacteriophage (T4) to display approximately 870 tail spike proteins (TSPs) derived from a lytic bacteriophage specific to target bacteria, along with about 30 gold nanoparticles (GNPs) of 5 nm at distinct capsid domains. Specifically, we fused the small outer capsid protein (Soc) of T4 with a TSP to obtain a fusion protein Soc-VP-TSP. In parallel, we fused the highly antigenic outer capsid protein (Hoc) with a biotin acceptor peptide (Avi-tag), generating the fusion protein Avi-Hoc. These two fusion proteins were co-assembled onto a T4ΔHS bacteriophage (T4ΔHS) capsid deficient in both native Hoc and Soc proteins, yielding a dual-functionalized phage (T4@TSPs@Avi) that simultaneously displays TSPs and Avi-tags. After covalent biotinylation via BirA biotin-protein ligase, the phages were conjugated to streptavidin-coated GNPs, forming a final detection probe termed T4@TSPs@GNPs. This dual-display T4 allows targeting bacteria to appear as visual golden rod-shaped structures under dark-field microscopy. To enable intelligent and efficient detection, we employed a DenseNet169 model combining saliency-guided region-of-interest extraction, multi-scale feature fusion, and Grad-CAM to accurately distinguish target bacteria from background noise. The entire detection process can be completed within 30 min, achieving a detection limit of 4 CFU/μL and an accuracy that is completely consistent with the gold standard. This integrated strategy provides a powerful and adaptable tool for intelligent pathogen detection in food safety, clinical diagnostics, and environmental monitoring.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-43">摘要</h3>
<p>Maintaining genome stability during DNA replication is a critical cellular challenge. Various surveillance and repair mechanisms have evolved to cope with replication stress, which can be caused by environmental insults, metabolic byproducts, complex DNA structures in the genome, and replication-transcription conflicts. This perspective highlights a newly identified cytosolic DNA/Ca2+-dependent signaling pathway that plays a crucial role in protecting stalled replication forks. The pathway involves cytosolic DNA generation and its sensing by the cGAS-cGAMP-STING axis, TRPV2-mediated Ca2+ release from the ER, and activation of a CaMKK2-AMPK protein phosphorylation cascade that suppresses the EXO1 nuclease, thereby preventing aberrant fork processing and preserving chromosomal integrity. Separate from the ATR/Chk1 checkpoint, this cytoDNA/Ca2+-dependent pathway represents a non-redundant mechanism for genome maintenance, with potentially important implications for cancer formation and its treatment. Moreover, the intersection of this pathway with other signaling networks also enables coordinated regulation of genome maintenance, immune response, autophagy, and cellular senescence.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-44">摘要</h3>
<p>Benzisothiazolinone (BIT), a most widely-used isothiazolinone biocide, has been detected in water environments, posing risks to aquatic ecosystems. However, toxicological studies of BIT in aquatic organisms are still limited. This study exposed zebrafish embryos to 0, 1, 10, 100, and 1000 μg/L BIT for 14 days, and investigated the effect of BIT on the innate immune function of larval fish. 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that BIT exposure reduced microbial diversity and richness, while increased pathogenic genera like Plesiomonas and Acinetobacter in larval fish. Then, the intestinal structure and gut barrier function were impaired, and the elevated lipopolysaccharides levels activated the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway and triggered a pro-inflammatory innate immune response in zebrafish. The ability of zebrafish to resist pathogen infection was further impaired, as indicated by a failed recruitment of macrophages in the intestinal area after Escherichia coli infection. Whereas, dietary administration of probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus ameliorated the immunotoxicity of BIT, and restored the zebrafish larvae’ immunity against pathogens. These findings elucidated the adverse effect of BIT on the innate immune function of larval zebrafish from the perspective of intestinal health and microbial disruption, and also provided insights into probiotic-based strategies for mitigating isothiazolinone biocides toxicity in aquatic organisms.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-45">摘要</h3>
<p>Obesity is a global public health issue, with over 1.9 billion adults reported to be either overweight or obese. Despite the high financial and health costs associated with obesity, the global prevalence of obesity across all age groups has been on the rise. Using the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, we provide evidence of the causal relationship between extreme temperature exposure and obesity. We show that there is a positive association between high temperatures (above 30°C) and obesity. Specifically, an additional day of exposure to temperatures above 30°C in a year is associated with a 0.02 percent increase in BMI and a 0.2 percent increase in the probability of being obese. We find these effects to be pronounced for older cohorts, and robust to alternative specifications and falsification of our extreme temperature exposure measure. We provide evidence that the underlying mechanisms for our baseline relationship are reduced physical activities and low internal locus of control due to extreme temperature exposure.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-46">摘要</h3>
<p>The molecular mechanisms underlying differences in somatic cell cloning efficiency among buffalo fetal fibroblasts (BFFs) from different individuals remain poorly understood. Our study conducted a comparative analysis of mitochondrial function and chromatin remodeling capacity of BFFs from different individuals, and tracked the mitochondria in the embryos derived from SCNT and IVF. These findings revealed that BFFs with high cloning efficiency displayed well-preserved mitochondrial morphology and ultrastructure, increased mitochondrial DNA copy number and ATP levels, elevated antioxidant capacity, enhanced mitochondrial membrane potential, and significantly upregulated expression levels of mitochondria-related genes. Meanwhile, BFFs with high cloning efficiency demonstrated significantly higher DNA enrichment, lower heterochromatin levels, and differential expression levels of chromatin remodeling-related genes. Furthermore, the persistence of donor cell mitochondria during cloned embryo development was observed, whereas sperm-derived mitochondria during IVF embryo development were rarely detectable. Collectively, our results suggest a tight connection between the mitochondria and chromatin remodeling of donor cells, and demonstrating their synergistic impact on cloning efficiency, providing the crucial experimental evidence for nucleo-mitochondrial interactions.</p>

<p>We investigated an atypical Listeria monocytogenes strain isolated from the food processing environment, which may evade widely used diagnostic approaches. After species confirmation using PCR and MALDI-TOF, enzyme analysis revealed reduced phospholipase activity, indicating a link between its activity and the white appearance of atypical strains on chromogenic agar. While no mutation was detected in the phospholipase C gene, comparative genomics revealed a distinct seven base pair insertion in the prfA gene, resulting in gene truncation. These results highlight the risk of false negatives in current diagnostics and a need for improved detection methods to ensure food safety.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-48">摘要</h3>
<p>Electronic Health Record (EHR) implementations significantly affect healthcare professionals’ work routines. Previous Epic implementations in Scandinavian hospitals have led to negative outcomes, highlighting the need for a thorough evaluation of employee experiences.
To qualitatively explore hospital employees’ experiences six months after Epic EHR implementation and assess implications for employee well-being and patient safety.
A qualitative study conducted at a Norwegian university hospital, six months post-implementation. Free-text responses from 950 employees (out of 2,115 survey respondents) were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis within a phenomenological framework. Data were triangulated with focus group interviews and observational findings.
Employees reported deep concerns and high emotional intensity post-implementation. Analysis revealed 13 themes, with usability being most prominent (n = 682 quotes). Participants described the system as cumbersome, inefficient, and counterintuitive. Other major themes included work strain and own health (n = 385), administration of medicine and patient safety (n = 201), and politics and hospital management (n = 184). Many employees experienced shifts in professional identity, with some expressing job abandonment intentions.
Poorly executed EHR implementations hinder professional performance, compromise patient care, and amplify emotional distress. Addressing workflow barriers and setting realistic expectations is critical for improving adoption. Future implementations must integrate employee perspectives and evidence-based strategies to ensure EHR systems enhance rather than obstruct healthcare delivery.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-49">摘要</h3>
<p>Loneliness and social isolation harm mental and physical health, yet existing public health strategies often fail to reflect the lived realities of equity-owed communities. To address this gap, our team has been developing potential public health guidelines aimed at fostering social connection in Canada. This study sought to engage five communities facing structural inequities (i.e. 2S/LGBTQ+ individuals, racialized communities, Indigenous peoples, people living with disabilities, and migrants/immigrants/refugees) in reviewing and refining draft public health guidelines. Specifically, we conducted 12 focus groups and 11 one-on-one interviews with 60 participants. During these interviews, we presented our guidelines to the participants, explored their lived experiences of social connection in relation to the guidelines, and elicited direct feedback on how the guidelines could be improved to address unique barriers and facilitators in these communities. Through thematic analysis of these data, we characterized participants’ perspectives relating to their (i) identity and belonging, (ii) safety and accessibility, (iii) structural and economic resources, (iv) the role of family, (v) social interactions shaped by discrimination, and (vi) recognized health impacts on social connection. Participants’ perspectives highlighted the complex interplay of cultural identity, discrimination, financial constraints, and unmet accessibility needs that limit meaningful social engagement. Their feedback identified specific ways to ensure that newly developed guidelines for social connection address critical equity concerns, including improved cultural relevance, accessibility, and community-level supports. These consultations offer clear guidance on tailoring social connection recommendations to the realities of equity-owed groups, underscoring the importance of structured community engagement in guideline development. Integrating these community-informed insights will help shape public health guidelines that are equitable, inclusive, and responsive to diverse lived experiences.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-50">摘要</h3>
<p>Air pollution is a major public health risk factor globally and a significant threat to people with respiratory conditions. People with asthma, and particularly those from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds, are disproportionally affected and have less capacity to protect themselves from air pollution. There is a critical lack of accessible resources and advice for people with asthma who are from CALD backgrounds. This qualitative study aimed to better understand Arabic-speaking Australians’ perceptions of air quality, support their health literacy, and co-design resources to help them reduce their exposure to air pollution. A virtual roundtable discussion was conducted with key stakeholders from Australian Arabic-speaking communities to explore perceptions of air pollution and effective ways to communicate related public health messages to people with asthma within these communities. Australian Arabic-speaking communities generally have low awareness of air pollution. Although they use social media platforms and traditional media widely, more needs to be done to raise their awareness of air pollution and related health issues through targeted bilingual (English-Arabic) messaging and audiovisual material. The importance of religious and other community leaders in promoting environmental and public health messages within the diverse Arabic-speaking communities was highlighted. Future asthma-awareness and air pollution literacy campaigns should be designed in ways that reach CALD communities that have previously been underserved by public health promotion. Culturally sensitive health communication approaches are particularly important as Australia’s population continues to diversify.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-51">摘要</h3>
<p>Epilepsy affects over 80 million people worldwide, with approximately 40% experiencing refractory seizures. Despite some progress in deciphering the complex process of epileptogenesis, which transforms a healthy brain into one susceptible to epilepsy, there are still no therapies available to prevent this condition. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of epilepsy in both military and civilian populations, often leading to the complex condition of posttraumatic epilepsy (PTE). Defined as recurrent seizures following TBI, PTE lacks effective treatment options, highlighting the need for improved experimental models and translational interventions. Unveiling disease-modifying therapeutics for epilepsy is a top priority in the field of neurology research. One major obstacle in PTE research is the lack of robust models that accurately reflect the multifaceted and heterogeneous nature of human PTE. Hence, developing disease-modifying treatments requires innovative models that facilitate the identification of novel therapeutic approaches. Establishing clinically relevant animal models is critical for elucidating the pathophysiological mechanisms of epileptogenesis and identifying effective therapies for PTE management. This article describes the opportunities and challenges associated with advances in PTE experimental models, including the call for common data elements to be developed for PTE. Inspired by insights from a 2023 workshop supported by the American Epilepsy Society, this review explores progress in animal models, experimental protocols, biomarkers, and principles of therapeutic interventions for TBI-induced seizures and posttraumatic epileptogenesis. It evaluates the PTE research landscape and critically discusses current strategies, innovations, hurdles and future directions for establishing models that ultimately lead to the development of disease-modifying agents and targeted therapeutic approaches for PTE prevention. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Posttraumatic epilepsy (PTE) lacks specific therapies due to limited experimental models. Here, we outline the proceedings of the 2023 American Epilepsy Society-supported National Workshop on PTE, covering small and large animal models for PTE research. This article provides insights into recent advancements in experimental paradigms and analyzes the validity and application of these models in identifying interventions to prevent epileptogenesis following traumatic brain injury. We address challenges and obstacles in discovering PTE therapies, offering clinical data context and common themes.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-52">摘要</h3>
<p>AbstractComplex interactions between animal migration and infection are increasingly recognized as important for shaping when and where wildlife are infectious. Bird migration may facilitate spatial spread of zoonotic pathogens but remains poorly understood, owing in part to limited seasonal sampling. Using serology for immunoglobulin Y antibodies, we evaluated seasonal exposure to West Nile virus (WNV) of American robins (Turdus migratorius) sampled monthly during 2021 and 2022 in Indiana and compared our seroprevalence results to those of robins from previous studies across North America using meta-analysis. Because robins overwintering in Indiana include local breeders and those breeding farther north, we next evaluated how the probability of WNV exposure varied by breeding latitude. We also tagged robins breeding in Indiana with tracking devices to evaluate whether exposure to WNV is related to movement distance. We found that robins in Indiana are exposed to WNV more frequently than robins in previous studies elsewhere in North America and in earlier years, but we found no effects of season, sex, or breeding latitude. However, robins with higher fat scores were more likely to be seropositive, which may indicate that these birds are more likely to survive infection. Our tracking data indicated that robins breeding in Indiana migrate several hundred miles to overwinter in the southeastern United States and that WNV seropositivity had no association with movement distance. The mean durations of spring and fall migration were 13 and 19 d, respectively, nearly the same as or moderately above the maximum WNV infectious period in robins. Although these results suggest that American robins have the capacity to move WNV long distances in spring, further studies are needed across the range of this host species to uncover its role in dispersing WNV.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-54">摘要</h3>
<p>Toxoplasma gondii infects almost all warm-blooded animals, including marine mammals. Toxoplasmosis has been reported in wild and captive marine mammals in North America; however, no viable T. gondii strains have been isolated from northern fur seals. In this study, reproduction and T. gondii infection status were investigated in 10 northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus), from tissues collected from 2012 to 2024 in China. Toxoplasma gondii infections were determined by the modified agglutination test (MAT), PCR, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, and isolation of the parasite by bioassay in mice. MAT was performed using placenta or tissue exudates to detect anti-T. gondii IgG antibodies. Four of the 10 seals had anti-T. gondii antibodies; Toxoplasma gondii DNA was detected by PCR in placenta tissues of two of these four animals, and T. gondii antibody positive reactions were observed in four seals by IHC. A viable T. gondii strain, TgFurSealCHn1, was isolated from placenta of one seal by bioassay in mice. In all, five seals had signs of T. gondii infection, and three of them had fetal stillbirth. One stillborn fetus had T. gondii nucleic acid detected by PCR, indicating potential vertical transmission of the parasite. Multilocus genetic typing of the TgFurSealCHn1 isolate revealed ToxoDB #5 genotype, which had demonstrated avirulence in Swiss Webster outbred mice, and the ROP18/ROP5 type was 2/2. ToxoDB #5 is the dominant genotype of wild terrestrial and marine mammals in North America. This is the first report of a viable T. gondii strain isolated from northern fur seal placenta.
Isolement de Toxoplasma gondii à partir du placenta d’otaries à fourrure du Nord (Callorhinus ursinus) et potentielle transmission transplacentaire du parasite.
Toxoplasma gondii infecte presque tous les animaux à sang chaud, y compris les mammifères marins. La toxoplasmose a été signalée chez des mammifères marins sauvages et captifs en Amérique du Nord; cependant, aucune souche viable de T. gondii n’a été isolée chez les otaries à fourrure du Nord. Dans cette étude, la reproduction et le statut infectieux de T. gondii ont été étudiés chez 10 otaries à fourrure du Nord (Callorhinus ursinus), à partir de tissus prélevés entre 2012 et 2024 en Chine. Les infections à Toxoplasma gondii ont été déterminées par le test d’agglutination modifié (TAM), la PCR, la coloration immunohistochimique (CIH) et l’isolement du parasite par bio-essai chez la souris. Le TAM a été réalisé à partir de placenta ou d’exsudats tissulaires afin de détecter des anticorps IgG anti-T. gondii. Quatre des 10 otaries présentaient des anti-T. gondii; l’ADN de T. gondii a été détecté par PCR dans les tissus placentaires de deux de ces quatre animaux, et des réactions positives aux anticorps anti-T. gondii ont été observées chez quatre otaries par CIH. Une souche viable de T. gondii, TgFurSealCHn1, a été isolée du placenta d’une otarie par bio-essai chez la souris. Au total, 5 otaries présentaient des signes d’infection à T. gondii, et 3 d’entre elles étaient mortes-nées. Un fœtus mort-né avait de l’acide nucléique de T. gondii détecté par PCR, indiquant une transmission verticale potentielle du parasite. Le typage génétique multilocus de l’isolat TgFurSealCHn1 a révélé le génotype ToxoDB #5, qui avait démontré une avirulence chez des souris non consanguines Swiss Webster, et le type ROP18/ROP5 était 2/2. ToxoDB #5 est le génotype dominant des mammifères terrestres et marins sauvages en Amérique du Nord. Il s’agit du premier rapport d’une souche viable de T. gondii isolée du placenta d’otarie à fourrure du Nord.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-55">摘要</h3>
<p>Alzheimer’s disease as a neurodegenerative disorder is characterized by a decline in cognitive abilities that makes it difficult or impossible to perform ordinary tasks. It is the most common form of dementia and its exact causes are still unknown. Approximately 45.0 million people are affected by this disease, which is the leading cause of death worldwide. Although numerous commercial drugs are available on the world market, many of them have mutagenic, toxic, carcinogenic and other side effects. Therefore, today the world’s trend is use of natural products without any harmful effects. Edible and medicinal mushrooms as producers of numerous biologically active compounds, such as polysaccharides, proteins, sterols, terpenoids, etc., could be a safe and effective neuroprotective agents and a promising therapy for patients with Alzheimer’s disease. Mushrooms are highly valued functional foods and diet supplementation with them could significantly reduce the risk of apparence of Alzheimer’s disease or slow down its development. The results of numerous studies have shown that the addition of mushrooms to the diet not only increases the effectiveness of conventional drugs but also reduces their harmful effects. However, despite numerous studies on mushrooms’ medicinal properties, much more in vivo research and clinical trials are still needed to fully understand the potential of mushrooms for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, as well as to determine their optimal administration. Reviewing all the results so far and considering future necessary studies were the main aims of this review article.</p>

<h2 id="article-57">57. Postoperative improvement in the index finger center of pressure trajectory during precision grip in patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy.</h2>

<h3 id="摘要-56">摘要</h3>
<p>The aim of this study was to kinetically evaluate the changes in precision grip in patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy before and after decompressive surgery.
Twenty-nine patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy participated in the study. Participants performed a grip-and-lift task by pulp pinch using their thumb and index finger before and after surgery. We monitored individual finger grip force (GF) and center of pressure (COP) trajectory in total five seconds and during the first second while lifting and holding an object. Correlations between the pre-operative COP trajectory and other hand clinical outcomes were analyzed. A multiple regression analysis was used to identify the predictive value of the pre-operative COP trajectory to the severity of sensorimotor dysfunction.
There was a significant improvement in the 1-second COP trajectory in the index finger after surgery, but not the GF. Moreover, pre-operative COP trajectory was associated with the post-operative severity of clinical symptoms. The multiple regression analysis concerning the severity of upper extremity symptoms indicated that the model incorporating pre-operative COP trajectory exhibited the highest adjusted R2 compared to GF or conventional clinical tests.
These results suggested that patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy could improve their COP trajectory in the index finger after surgery, and the finger kinetic measure could provide an important index for predicting neurological improvement.</p>
