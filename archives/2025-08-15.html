<h2 id="article-1">1. Beyond poverty alleviation: The impact of child support grants on healthcare access and contraception use in South Africa.</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: Dialogues in health
<strong>发表日期</strong>: 2025-Dec
<strong>链接</strong>: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40809838">PubMed</a></p>

<h3 id="摘要">摘要</h3>
<p>This study examines the impact of Child Support Grants (CSGs) on access to medical care and contraception use in South Africa, investigating whether social assistance can enhance healthcare access beyond its primary aim of alleviating poverty. While previous research highlights CSGs’ poverty reduction and welfare enhancement effects, little is known about their effects on healthcare and reproductive healthcare access, especially given South Africa’s healthcare disparities. Using data from the first wave of the 2020 National Income Dynamics Study-Coronavirus Rapid Mobile Survey (NIDS-CRAM), this study employs mediation analysis to analyse the effects of CSG receipt on healthcare and contraception access while controlling for socio-economic factors. The findings indicate a complex relationship. CSGs have a positive but insignificant indirect effect on healthcare and contraception access and a significant negative direct effect, suggesting that the current grant structure may not adequately address existing barriers. The results highlight the need for policy changes, indicating that while CSGs are vital as a social safety net, their effectiveness in improving healthcare access could be enhanced through increased grant amounts and targeted interventions to address healthcare costs and structural barriers.</p>

<h2 id="article-2">2. Emerging Biosensor Technologies for Stroke Biomarker Detection: A Comprehensive Overview.</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: Analytical science advances
<strong>发表日期</strong>: 2025-Dec
<strong>链接</strong>: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40809834">PubMed</a></p>

<h3 id="摘要-1">摘要</h3>
<p>Stroke remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, necessitating the development of rapid and reliable diagnostic tools for early detection and management. This manuscript presents an overview of innovative biosensors designed for the detection of key stroke biomarkers, including N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, cardiac troponins, S100B protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light chain (NfL), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), interleukins and fibrinogen. We discuss the principles of operation, sensitivity, specificity and the technological advancements that have enabled the development of these biosensors, including electrochemical, optical and microfluidic platforms. The integration of nanomaterials and advanced signal amplification techniques has significantly enhanced the performance of these biosensors, allowing for the detection of biomarkers at low concentrations in complex biological samples. Furthermore, we explore the clinical implications of these biosensors in the context of stroke diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring, highlighting their potential to facilitate timely therapeutic interventions. By providing a comprehensive discussion on the current state of biosensor technology for stroke biomarker detection, this manuscript aims to underscore the importance of these tools in improving patient outcomes and advancing stroke research. Future directions for biosensor development and the challenges that remain in translating these technologies into clinical practice are also addressed.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-2">摘要</h3>
<p>Inadequately managed chronic diseases heighten cardiovascular risk. Improved dietary habits are crucial for risk reduction and enhanced patient health. This study evaluated the sustained impact of a hybrid self-care education program on diet quality and cardiovascular risk in patients with chronic conditions.
In this 2023 randomized controlled trial in Saravan, Iran, 150 patients with chronic conditions were enrolled. Participants were randomly allocated to an intervention group (n = 75) or a control group (n = 75). Data were collected using a self-care nutrition questionnaire and the Mini-EAT. The intervention group received a one-month hybrid self-care education program integrating the Teach-Back method with digital education, followed by monthly follow-ups. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 26 with repeated measures ANOVA, one-way ANOVA, independent t-tests, and chi-square tests (statistical significance: p &lt; 0.05). Follow-up assessments occurred at 3 and 12 months post-intervention.
Post-intervention, nutritional self-care scores in the intervention group increased significantly from baseline (11.90) to 3 months (24.12) and remained stable at 12 months (23.74; p &lt; 0.001). No comparable change occurred in controls. Diet quality improved markedly: the proportion with unhealthy diets decreased from 98.67 % to 49.34 %, while adherence to healthy diets rose from 0 % to 13.33 % (p &lt; 0.001). At the 12-month follow-up, statistically significant reductions were observed across all key cardiovascular risk metrics: systolic blood pressure decreased from 142.21 mmHg to 132.22 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure from 104.70 mmHg to 92.16 mmHg, fasting blood glucose from 212.66 mg/dL to 151.48 mg/dL, and BMI from 27.91 kg/m2 to 25.32 kg/m2 (all p &lt; 0.001).
The integrated Teach-Back and digital education intervention produced sustained improvements in nutritional self-care, diet quality, and cardiovascular risk factors among patients with chronic conditions. Effect durability at 12 months underscores the value of ongoing follow-up in educational strategies. These findings support integrating digital education into health promotion programs to reinforce self-care behaviors and improve clinical outcomes.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-3">摘要</h3>
<p>Soil pollution on agricultural land has become a significant concern in major tea-producing regions, including Tamil Nadu, a prominent tea-producing state in India. The excessive use of agrochemicals in tea plantations leads to soil contamination, which in turn pollutes tea plantation soil. Tea soil samples were collected in six different tea plantations in commercially important regions from Valparai (Coimbatore), Coonoor, Kundha, Kothagiri, Kattabettu, and Gudalur (Nilgiris), in Tamil Nadu, India. The samples were taken from depths of 0-25 cm across distances ranging from 0-250 m. These samples were digestion procedure followed AOAC method. To assess human health risks, both carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic effects will be evaluated across three primary exposure pathways: ingestion, inhalation, and dermal contact. The study conducted in six major tea-cultivated soils. Five tea plantations’ soil samples are highly contaminated with cadmium and at high risk. Geoaccumulation index shows cadmium strongly contaminated in Valparai, Coonoor, and extremely contaminated in Kundha, Kothagiri, and Ooty tea soil samples. The Total Cancer Risk (TCR) in the study area mainly ingestion route values: Cd (0.0000364-0.0000583), followed by Cr (0.0000293-0.0000468), As (0.0000105-0.0000168), and Ni (0.00000269-0.00000431) All the values were higher than USEPA’s of 1 × 106-1 × 104 (USEPA, 2004) consequently, children’s health will be severely affected compared to adults. The current study shows that due to the excess use of agrochemicals and short tea crop cultivation periods, a large amount of heavy metals accumulates in tea plantation soil. As a result, understanding toxic metals and emphasizing the reduction of agrochemicals and the extension of the tea crop cultivation period is crucial. Because soil health is key for food quality, sustainable agriculture, and increasing economic value.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-4">摘要</h3>
<p>The associations between metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and specific cardiovascular events, as well as their attributable burdens, remain inconsistent and underexplored within a single population. This large-scale prospective cohort evaluated the associations between MASLD and various cardiovascular outcomes. Two additional steatotic liver disease (SLD) subtypes - MASLD with increased alcohol consumption (MetALD) and alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) - were also evaluated.
We included 303,589 adults aged ≥30 years from Taiwan who underwent health examinations between 1997 and 2013. MASLD was defined by ultrasound-detected steatosis, limited alcohol intake, and ≥1 cardiometabolic risk factor. MetALD and ALD were defined based on alcohol intake thresholds and cardiometabolic profiles. Participants were followed until 2020, with outcomes and mortality ascertained via linkage to national registries. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted relative risks (RRs), and population attributable fractions (PAFs) were calculated.
Of the total population, 91,877 (30.3%) had MASLD, 7,490 (2.5%) had MetALD, 5,576 (1.8%) had ALD, and 198,646 (65.4%) did not have SLD. Over a median follow-up of 10.4 years, 162,959 cardiovascular events occurred. The adjusted RR of any cardiovascular diseases was 1.29 (95% CI 1.38-1.31) for MASLD, 1.38 (95% CI 1.34-1.42) for MetALD, and 1.48 (95% CI 1.43-1.53) for ALD. Among all SLD subtypes, MASLD showed the highest RR for myocardial infarction (RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.36-1.56). Findings remained consistent after accounting for liver-related deaths. The PAF for MASLD was 8.07% (95% CI 7.81-8.58). Despite higher risks, MetALD and ALD had lower PAFs due to lower prevalence.
All major SLD subtypes - MASLD, MetALD, and ALD - were associated with increased long-term cardiovascular risk, underscoring the need for early detection and cardiometabolic risk management across the SLD spectrum.
This large-scale study of 303,589 individuals demonstrates that metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases by at least 29%. Cardiovascular risk further escalates across SLD subtypes with higher levels of alcohol consumption. Notably, MASLD was associated with the highest risk of myocardial infarction among all SLD subtypes. By quantifying population burden, we found that 8.07% of cardiovascular events may be preventable through effective MASLD prevention strategies, highlighting the critical role of cardiometabolic risk management. These findings emphasize the need to integrate MASLD identification and prevention into broader cardiometabolic care and public health frameworks.

<h3 id="摘要-5">摘要</h3>
<p>Cholangiocarcinomas have a poor prognosis, and the incidence is rising in most countries. We examined time-trends in incidence and mortality in a nationwide Danish cohort.
We used nationwide health databases to identify all Danish citizens diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma from 1995 to 2022. We computed age-standardised incidence rates, stage distribution, and age- and sex-adjusted 1-year mortality.
The median age of the 5,787 patients with cholangiocarcinoma was 72 years, and 53% were female. Overall, the age-standardised incidence rate per 100,000 person-years almost doubled, from 3.93 (95% CI 3.59-4.26) in 1995-1998 to 6.79 (6.42-7.16) in 2019-2022. This rate increased five-fold for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma from 0.75 (0.61-0.90) in 1995-1998 to 3.85 (3.57-4.13) in 2019-2022, while for extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma it decreased from 2.42 (2.16-2.69) in 1995-1998 to 1.30 (1.14-1.47) in 2019-2022. Although individuals aged 18-59 years had the lowest incidence rate of cholangiocarcinoma (any type), they experienced the steepest annual increase (3.2% vs. 2.7% in those aged 60-79 and 2.1% in those ≥80 years; p for interaction = 0.01). Among all patients with cholangiocarcinoma, the proportion with localised resectable disease increased from 7% in 2004-2006 to 12% in 2019-2022. We saw a decrease in age- and sex-adjusted 1-year mortality between 1995 and 2022: 81% (77-84) in 1995-1998 vs. 65% (63-68) in 2019-2022. The decrease in 1-year mortality was universal, with the largest decrease in patients aged 18-59 years (from 67% in 1995-1998 to 49% in 2019-2022) and in 60-79-year-olds.
The incidence of cholangiocarcinoma in Denmark increased in 1995-2022, driven by an increasing incidence of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Meanwhile, 1-year mortality decreased, likely reflecting earlier diagnosis and better treatments.
Cholangiocarcinomas have a poor prognosis, and the incidence is rising in most countries. In Europe, all countries but Denmark have shown an increasing incidence of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The incidence of cholangiocarcinoma in Denmark between 1995 and 2022 increased, driven by a large increase in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas. The proportion with localised resectable disease increased while 1-year mortality decreased, though it remained high (65% in 2019-2022). Knowledge of incidence and mortality risk is valuable for doctors to understand the disease, identify risk factors, and design preventive care studies; for healthcare providers to allocate resources; and for patients to understand their prognosis.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-6">摘要</h3>
<p>Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are highly specialized components of the hepatic vascular niche, regulating liver function and disease pathogenesis through angiocrine signaling. Recently, we identified GATA4 as a key transcription factor controlling LSEC development and protecting against liver fibrosis. As the transcription factor c-Maf was strongly downregulated in Gata4-deficient LSECs, we hypothesized that c-Maf might be an important downstream effector of GATA4 in LSEC differentiation and liver fibrogenesis.
Clec4g-iCre/Maf fl/fl (Maf LSEC-KO ) mice with LSEC-specific Maf deficiency were generated and liver tissue was analyzed histologically. LSECs were isolated for bulk RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and single-cell (sc) RNA-seq analysis. Maf LSEC-KO livers were analyzed after MASH diet feeding. The expression of MAF and its targets was analyzed in published human scRNA-seq data.
Endothelial Maf deficiency resulted in perisinusoidal liver fibrosis (Sirius red 0.46% vs. 2.92%; p &lt;0.05) without affecting metabolic liver zonation, accompanied by a switch from sinusoidal to continuous endothelial cell identity, which was aggravated upon MASH diet feeding (p &lt;0.01). Furthermore, endothelial Maf deficiency caused LSEC proliferation (p &lt;0.05) and expression of profibrotic angiocrine factors including Pdgfb, Igfbp5, Flrt2, and Cxcl12, among which FLRT2 (p &lt;0.01) and CXCL12 (p &lt;0.001) activated hepatic stellate cells in vitro. scRNA-seq revealed replacement of zonated LSEC subpopulations with capillarized, proliferative, sprouting and secretory endothelial cell subsets that promote liver fibrogenesis and angiogenesis. This fundamental dysregulation of LSEC gene expression and differentiation was caused by changes in chromatin accessibility and transcription factor activity following loss of Maf. Notably, endothelial MAF expression was also significantly reduced in human cirrhotic livers (p &lt;0.0001).
Hepatic endothelial c-Maf protects against metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis-like liver fibrosis and regulates endothelial differentiation and zonation by controlling chromatin opening.
This work builds on the known importance of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells in liver function and disease. Here, transcription factor c-Maf is identified as a master regulator in maintaining normal differentiation and zonation of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, thereby protecting against the development of liver fibrosis/cirrhosis. The findings are significant for researchers and clinicians focusing on liver disease, as they suggest potential new targets for therapeutic intervention. These findings could instruct the development of novel preventive treatment options and antifibrotic therapy regimens as well as liver repair strategies, benefiting patients, clinicians and policy makers in the management of liver disease.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-7">摘要</h3>
<p>Anesthesia services are a major contributor to healthcare sector greenhouse gas emissions. Interventions aimed to reduce waste are necessary. Reusable anesthesia circuits offer a sustainable alternative to single-use circuits. Their adoption in the United States remains limited. The objective of this project was to evaluate the feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and environmental impact of using FDA-approved reusable anesthesia circuits.
Supported by the SMART QI framework, we evaluated the impact of switching to reusable circuits on elective electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) procedures. We measured waste generation, room preparation times, material costs, and projected system wide financial and greenhouse gas emissions impact. Greenhouse gas emissions were estimated using the Practice Greenhealth Scope 3 Emissions Accounting Tool. Descriptive statistics compared pre- and post-intervention outcomes, with statistical significance at p &lt; 0.05.
We compared 185 ECT procedures: 98 single-use from pre-intervention and 87 reusable circuits from post-intervention. Preparation times did not change. Daily waste from reusable circuits was significantly lower than single-use circuits (99.2g vs. 357.2g, p &lt; 0.001). Cost analysis revealed 40% reduction in median per-case expenditures with reusable circuits ($4.30 vs. $8.50 per patient, p &lt; 0.001).Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions per procedure decreased nearly 50% (1.09 kgCO2 vs. 2.57 kgCO2, p &lt; 0.001). Modeling of institutional-level data projected an annual cost savings of $108,860 and a reduction of 45,062.4 kgCO2 if reusable circuits were implemented across all hospitals in the network.
Reusable anesthesia circuits can significantly reduce hospital waste, lower costs, and decrease carbon emissions without compromising procedural efficiency.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-8">摘要</h3>
<p>In-stent restenosis (ISR) remains a significant complication of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for left main coronary artery (LMCA) disease, with potentially severe consequences. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence and predictors of ISR and highlight the role of systematic angiographic follow-up in optimizing patient outcomes. We conducted a retrospective cohort study including 229 patients who underwent LMCA PCI between 2013 and 2023 at ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia. All patients underwent systematic angiographic follow-up at 8 months. Data on clinical, angiographic, and procedural characteristics were collected and analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression to identify predictors of ISR. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was employed to assess outcomes. ISR was identified in 24 patients (10.5%) during angiographic follow-up, with 29.2% being symptomatic. Chronic kidney disease (CKD; odds ratio: 3.84, P = 0.003) and diabetes (odds ratio: 3.18, P = 0.008) emerged as independent predictors of ISR. Multivariate analysis confirmed these associations. Survival rates were high, with 97.7% at 1 year, 92.2% at 2 years, and 81.5% at 4 years. Subanalyses showed trends toward higher mortality among patients with CKD or diabetes but no significant differences between patients with acute and chronic coronary syndromes. In conclusion, ISR remains a clinically significant challenge after LMCA PCI, with CKD and diabetes as key predictors. Systematic angiographic follow-up is essential for early ISR detection, especially in high-risk populations, as the majority of cases are asymptomatic. These findings emphasize the need for tailored surveillance strategies to improve outcomes.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-10">摘要</h3>
<p>An infectious disease such as COVID-19 posed a threat to public health worldwide due to its high infection rate and its further mutation into novel variants. Vaccination serves as a vital tool to interrupt its transmission cycle and far-reaching effects. However, the effectiveness of vaccination depends upon a well-planned strategy. This study explores the comparison between full and partial vaccination strategies using a novel fractional SVIR mathematical model with Caputo fractional derivative. The model categorizes vaccinated individuals into two groups: partially and fully vaccinated class. To account for limited medical resources and virus reemergence, we adopt the Holling type III saturated treatment function for treatment rate. In the analysis, we first show well posedness of model solutions. Further, we discuss the stability of the two equilibria exhibited by the system: DFE (Disease Free Equilibrium) and EE (Endemic Equilibrium). It is shown that the DFE is locally asymptotically stable when R0 &lt; 1, and EE is locally asymptotic stable by Routh-Hurwitz criterion. Moreover, both the equilibrium points are proved to be globally asymptotically stable under certain conditions with the help of appropriate Lyapunov function. Numerical simulations are also performed to validate the analytical findings using MATLAB. The quantification of effects of partial and full vaccination reveals that full vaccination results in higher percentage of recovered population, making it evident that policymakers and professionals should focus on the implications of effective full vaccination among susceptible individuals.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-11">摘要</h3>
<p>Type 2 diabetes is a growing global concern with serious complications, including kidney damage and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Monitoring albuminuria, which is associated with these complications, is crucial in optimal diabetes management. Gut microbiota composition has been suggested to impact albuminuria, but large studies with granular data are lacking.
We investigated the relationship between 1002 gut microbial species, 1308 plasma metabolites and albuminuria in 752 participants with type 2 diabetes from the Swedish CArdioPulmonary BioImage Study. To determine the relative abundance of species, we employed deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing of fecal samples. Plasma metabolites were analyzed using mass spectrometry-based methods.
We identified three species that were associated with albuminuria, including Sellimonas intestinalis, Eggerthellales sp., Ellagibacter isourolithinifaciens. Two of these species were replicated in an independent pre-diabetic population (n=3,423) in SCAPIS. In total, 36 annotated metabolites were associated with the three albuminuria-signature species. Functional mapping of the signature species suggests a role in the regulation of the metabolites of imidazole propionate and trigonelline, which have previously been reported to play roles in the progression of albuminuria.
These findings provide additional evidence of the potential impact of microbial species and contribute to our understanding of the complex relationship between the gut microbiome, plasma metabolites, and albuminuria in individuals with diabetes.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-12">摘要</h3>
<p>The advent of nanotechnology has transformed drug development, providing innovative solutions for designing and administering therapeutic agents with improved accuracy and efficacy in managing diabetes. This review aims to critically analyse the progress, mechanisms, and therapeutic uses of nanotechnology-based treatments against the diseases.
The application of nanotechnology in diabetes therapy represents a significant breakthrough in contemporary medicine. By facilitating precise, controlled, and responsive drug delivery systems, nanotechnology-based treatments present considerable advantages over traditional methods.
Glipizide sustained-release nanoparticles, repaglinide-loaded polymeric systems, and metformin-loaded alginate nanocapsules are just a few of the nanoformulations that have shown markedly improved pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy in preclinical models. In addition to lowering the frequency of doses, these nano-delivery methods extended glycaemic control and enhanced oral bioavailability. Niosomes and solid lipid nanoparticles are two examples of formulations that have demonstrated promise in overcoming physiological obstacles such poor intestinal absorption and enzymatic breakdown. When taken as a whole, these results highlight how revolutionary nanotechnology can be for managing diabetes.
The development of new nano formulations shows great promise in preventing hyperglycaemia and improving diabetes management; however, challenges such as biocompatibility, scalability, and regulatory approval pose substantial obstacles to clinical implementation. Nevertheless, the expanding roles of nanotechnology in diabetes therapy present transformative opportunities, highlighting the necessity for ongoing interdisciplinary research to refine these nanotherapeutics for safe and effective clinical applications.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-13">摘要</h3>
<p>Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) is an effective method for diagnosing and managing postpartum hypertension, a condition associated with increased health risks. A 5-minute seated rest before home blood pressure (BP) measurement is recommended; however, compliance to this recommendation and its impact on HBPM reading in postpartum women is unknown.
A subset of participants enrolled in a pregnancy cohort were followed at 3 and 6 months postpartum. At each assessment, participants completed HBPM for seven days with an oscillometric device and concurrently wore an accelerometer on their thigh to assess postures. Mixed-effects models and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were utilized to analyze BP differences and measurement reliability between 5-minute rest compliant and non-compliant readings, respectively.
45 participants (mean age: 30.5 years) provided HBPM data at 3 and/or 6 months postpartum, with 90.2% of requested BP measures taken. Approximately 33% of readings adhered to the 5-minute rest protocol. Compliant readings averaged lower systolic and diastolic BP values than non-compliant readings (SBP: 105.9 mmHg vs. 107.1 mmHg; DBP: 72.6 mmHg vs. 73.2 mmHg), but differences were not clinically relevant. Compliant DBP ICCs fell within the good reliability range (ICCs: 0.785 - 0.817), while other ICCs indicated moderate reliability.
Despite low compliance with 5 minutes of seated rest prior to HBPM, the minimal impact on BP values suggests HBPM remains a useful monitoring strategy in postpartum women, even if the pre-measurement rest is not always possible. Future research could evaluate whether shorter pre-measurement rest recommendations produce similar findings.</p>

<p>Bispecific antibodies utilizing the transferrin receptor (TfR) for transport into the brain are being developed for both therapeutic and diagnostic targeting of the amyloid-β (Aβ) protein that deposits in the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brain. In contrast to traditional antibodies, TfR-binding bispecific antibodies display rapid and efficient brain uptake. However, due to differences in pharmacokinetic properties, it has been challenging to directly compare mono- and bispecific antibody brain uptake in vivo. Here, we have studied the Aβ antibody Bapineuzumab (Bapi) and its bispecific variant Bapi-Fab8D3, which contains a fragment of the TfR-binding antibody 8D3, enabling receptor-mediated transcytosis into the brain. Both antibodies were engineered to reduce binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), thereby increasing their clearance from the blood. The antibodies were radiolabeled with fluorine-18 (18F) and administered to wildtype (WT) mice, which were PET scanned in an alternating manner to visualize antibody brain pharmacokinetics over a period of 9 h, followed by ex vivo analyses. Next, the bispecific antibody [18F]-F-Bapi-Fab8D3FcRn- was used for PET imaging to quantify Aβ pathology in AD mouse model App NL‑G‑F mice at 12 h after antibody administration. [18F]-F-Bapi FcRn- and [18F]-F-Bapi-Fab8D3FcRn- had identical blood concentration curves in the WT mice. PET data quantification demonstrated that while the brain concentration of [18F]-F-BapiFcRn- declined, that of [18F]-F-Bapi-Fab8D3FcRn- increased throughout the 9 h time period, indicative of its active transport into the brain. PET imaging discriminated App NL‑G‑F from WT mice at 12 h after [18F]-F-Bapi-Fab8D3FcRn- administration, suggesting that this novel antibody-based tracer may be used for the same-day PET imaging of Aβ.</p>

A gadolinium chelate conjugated with vanillic acid (Gd-DO3A-Va) serves as a contrast agent that specifically targets activated microglia in the brains of Alzheimer’s disease animal models, such as the 5XFAD mouse. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of Gd-DO3A-Va in this model. The 5XFAD mouse exhibits neuroinflammation, characterized by activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway, inflammasome activation, and increased amyloid-β (Aβ) productionall of which are pathological features of Alzheimer’s disease. Treatment with Gd-DO3A-Va reduced inflammatory responses and Aβ deposits. Additionally, the peri-plaque dendritic loss observed in the brains of 5XFAD mice was attenuated following Gd-DO3A-Va treatment. Moreover, Gd-DO3A-Va treatment prevented memory loss, as indicated by the Y-maze test. Taken together, these findings suggest that Gd-DO3A-Va, an MR contrast agent that provides disease-specific signal enhancement in the brains of animal models of Alzheimer’s disease, shows promising therapeutic potential for preventing disease progression by suppressing inflammation and inhibiting Aβ production. Therefore, Gd-DO3A-Va could serve as a theranostic agent for Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-16">摘要</h3>
<p>While cardiovascular diseases continue to be the foremost cause of death worldwide, heart failure constitutes a major segment responsible for these mortalities. Heart failure results from exhausted cardiac myocytes that lose the ability to pump blood effectively. Cardiac hypertrophy is a condition of the heart wherein the thickening of the cardiomyocytes leads to an abnormal enlargement of the myocardium. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in the development of cardiac hypertrophy by regulating cell growth, proliferation, metabolism, and survival in cardiac myocytes. The phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) is a membrane-bound lipid phosphatase that facilitates dephosphorylation of PIP3 to PIP2, thus preventing the hyperactivation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Augmentation of PTEN expression and activity can hinder cardiac hypertrophy and mitigate the risk of heart failure. The present review discusses the role of PTEN in controlling unchecked cardiomyocyte proliferation and provides an account of the novel findings from current research on the noncoding RNAs and proteins interacting with PTEN. The review further discusses the pharmacological agents that restore PTEN expression and function and may emerge as effective therapeutics for the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-17">摘要</h3>
<p>New particle formation (NPF) is a major source of atmospheric aerosol particles, significantly influencing particle number concentrations in urban environments. High condensation and coagulation sinks at highly trafficked roadside sites should suppress NPF due to the low survival probability of clusters and new particles, however, observations show that roadside NPF is frequent and intense. Here, we investigate NPF at an urban background and roadside site in Central Europe using simultaneous measurements of sulfuric acid, amines, highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs), and particle number size distributions. We demonstrate that sulfuric acid and amines, particularly traffic-derived C2-amines, are the primary participants in particle formation. C2-amine concentrations at the roadside are enhanced by over a factor of 4 relative to the background, overcoming the effect of enhanced coagulation and condensation sinks. Using machine learning we identify a further but uncertain enhancing role of HOMs. These findings reveal the critical role of traffic emissions in urban NPF.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-18">摘要</h3>
<p>Secondary organic aerosol (SOA), a major component of submicrometer particles, is critical to the climate and human health. SOA can form through nucleation of low-volatility organic compounds, following atmospheric oxidation, or by condensing these vapors onto existing particles. In either of these cases, the formation of SOA particles could be affected by atmospheric conditions (e.g., relative humidity (RH)) and particle liquid water content. This study examines the effects of RH on the formation and composition of SOA from dark α-pinene (C10H16) ozonolysis, as a canonical system, with or without ammonium sulfate (AS, (NH4)2SO4) seed particles across varying RH levels. Using online extractive electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, we identified monomers (C7-10) and dimers (C15-20) in the SOA with high chemical and temporal resolution. In both cases, high RH (&gt;90%) promotes dimer formation in the particle phase, while they appear at the beginning of the experiment when (NH4)2SO4 seeds are present. The prompt increase in dimers in high RH seed containing experiments (60-65% dimers), which are absent at low RH (10%), suggests that intraparticle reactions are responsible for the dimer formation.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-19">摘要</h3>
<p>Missing sulfate production pathways have been implicated as the cause of model underestimates of sulfate during haze events in East Asia. We add multiphase oxidation of SO2 in aerosol particles by H2O2, O3, NO2, HCHO, and O2, catalyzed by transition metal ions (TMIs), to the GEOS-Chem model and evaluate the model with (1) year-round ground-based observations in Seoul, South Korea, (2) airborne observations from the KORUS-AQ field campaign, and (3) fall and winter ground-based observations in Beijing, China. Multiphase chemistry contributes 14% to 90% to total sulfate production depending on the location and season and increases model daily average sulfate by 2 to 3 μg m-3, with maximum daily increases up to 12 μg m-3. From winter to summer, oxidation pathways shift, with the largest fraction of multiphase sulfate production occurring during spring and summer due to oxidation by H2O2. Multiphase oxidation of SO2 by the H2O2 pathway reduces gas-phase H2O2 concentrations by -40% in spring, which improves model agreement with H2O2 airborne observations. Oxidation pathways also shift between cities, in particular the contribution from the TMI and NO2 pathways, which are more important in Beijing than in Seoul. This is due to higher levels of transition metals, and a larger impact of an overly shallow mixed layer in Beijing compared to Seoul. The implementation of multiphase aerosol chemistry in GEOS-Chem here allows for the use of this chemistry in other models that can address boundary layer errors, including WRF-GC and CESM-GC. The analysis presented here shows that this chemistry is important to the simulation of sulfate year-round, not only during haze events, and is unique in showing coupled gas- and aerosol-phase impacts of multiphase chemistry.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-20">摘要</h3>
<p>To evaluate the effect of Fuzi Lizhong decoction on intestinal flora, serum inflammatory factors, and hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) in patients with colorectal cancer associated with spleen and kidney Yang deficiency.
A total of 100 patients diagnosed with advanced colorectal cancer were randomly divided into two groups: a control group (CON, 50) and a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) group (n = 50). The control group received treatment with the Capecitabine + Oxaliplatin (CAPEOX) regimen, while the TCM group received the same regimen along with Fuzi Lizhong decoction for six weeks. Changes in intestinal flora were assessed before and after six weeks in both groups. Serum markers, including HIF-1α, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Adverse reactions, clinical efficacy, and TCM syndrome efficacy were also monitored.
After six weeks, the levels of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium were significantly higher, while the levels of Enterobacter and Enterococcus were significantly lower in the TCM group compared to the control group (P &lt; 0.05). Serum levels of HIF-1α, VEGF, IL-6, and TNF-α were also significantly reduced in the TCM group compared to the control group (P &lt; 0.05). Additionally, the incidence of adverse reactions was lower, and the clinical efficacy was higher in the TCM group compared to the control group (P &lt; 0.05).
Fuzi Lizhong decoction effectively improves intestinal microbiota composition, reduces inflammatory factors and HIF-1α expression, alleviates chemotherapy-related adverse reactions, enhances clinical efficacy, and may inhibit tumor growth in patients with colorectal cancer.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-21">摘要</h3>
<p>Flag football, a noncontact variant of American football, has gained significant interest in the United States and globally, which has been attributed to its accessibility, low cost, and perceived safety compared with traditional tackle football.
To identify the trends, primary mechanisms, and distributions of American flag football injuries among female athletes to better inform prevention and safety measures.
Descriptive epidemiology study.
Data analyzed in this study were extracted from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), a public database representing approximately 100 US emergency departments (EDs) that provides national injury estimates. NEISS was queried for all flag football injuries in female patients from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2023. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the distribution of injury by age, mechanism, diagnosis, and body region. Linear regression was used to analyze changes in injury rates over time.
Across the study period, 605 female patients with flag football injuries were evaluated at US EDs, extrapolating to a national estimate (NE) of 22,666 injuries from 2014 to 2023. The highest frequency of injuries occurred in 2023 (NE = 3531; 15.6%) and the lowest in 2020 (NE = 436; 1.9%). The most common injury diagnosis was found to be strain/sprain (NE = 6835; 30.2%), with adolescents aged 11 to 20 years sustaining the greatest number of injuries across all diagnoses. The most commonly affected body part was the finger (NE = 137; 22.6%). When analyzing the mechanism of injury, the most common cause was fall, including fall on an outstretched hand (NE = 4321; 19.1%). In addition, the majority of patients were treated and released (NE = 22,253; 98.2%).
This study demonstrated that from 2014 to 2023, female flag football injuries reported to US EDs remained relatively stable, dropping in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic and peaking in 2023. The most common injuries sustained by female athletes playing flag football were strains/sprains and fractures. Given the high prevalence of injuries sustained in the adolescent population, the use of appropriate protective gear should be emphasized to prevent a precipitous rise in injuries as the sport continues to grow in popularity throughout the country.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-22">摘要</h3>
<p>Educational attainment may influence colorectal cancer (CRC) risks, though the association remains inconclusive. The association might be mediated by health behaviors. This study aimed to explore the association of education on risks of CRC and to elucidate the mediatory effects of lifestyle-associated factors.
This case-control study included 174 cases and 296 healthy controls. We used a semi-structured questionnaire to collect information on participants’ sociodemographic factors (age, sex, marital status, monthly income, and family history of CRC) and lifestyle-associated behaviors (smoking status, physical activity, and frequency of red meat, legumes, and vegetables intake). Body mass index (BMI) was calculated using body mass measured at first contact. Participants’ education was categorized into those who completed basic education (≥ 12 years) and those who did not complete basic education (&lt; 12 years). Logistic and multiple logistic regression analyses were employed to test the correlation between education and risk of CRC, adjusted by sociodemographic and lifestyle-associated factors. Path analysis was performed to test the mediatory effect of lifestyle-associated behaviors on the correlation.
Participants with lower educational attainment had higher odds of CRC (odds ratio (OR) = 4.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.07 - 7.38), and the association remained consistent when adjusted by sociodemographic factors (adjusted OR (aOR) = 3.06, 95% CI = 1.86 - 5.03) and combined with lifestyle-associated behaviors (aOR = 2.73, 95% CI = 1.43 - 5.22). The association were consistent among men (OR = 6.14, 95% CI = 3.12 - 12.06; aOR = 4.65, 95% CI = 2.19 - 9.87; aOR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.02 - 1.09), yet no longer significant among women when adjusted with sociodemographic and lifestyle-associated factors (OR = 3.91, 95% CI = 2.19 - 6.97; aOR = 2.02, 95% CI = 1.02 - 4.00; aOR = 1.56, 95% CI = 0.61 - 3.95). Path analysis showed that the association between educational attainment and risk of CRC was mediated by physical activity, BMI, and intake of red meat, legumes, and vegetables.
In our study, educational attainment was inversely correlated with the odds of CRC and might be mediated by physical activity, BMI, and intake of red meat, legumes, and vegetables. Taking other sociodemographic and lifestyle-associated factors into account, the association between lower educational attainment and higher odds of CRC was more substantial among men. These findings highlight the importance of promoting education and healthy lifestyle behaviors, particularly among men, as an essential part of targeted public health strategies in reducing burden of CRC.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-23">摘要</h3>
<p>Despite recent advances in sickle cell disease (SCD) research and management, there remains very limited information available on critically ill SCD patients requiring intensive care units (ICUs).
The National Inpatient Sample was queried using the International Classification of Diseases codes to identify critically ill patients with SCD requiring ICU admission. These patients were further stratified into those with and without adverse clinical events (ACEs). The study outcomes were the incidence of acute chest syndrome, cardiac arrest, hemodialysis, sepsis, shock, and transfusion.
Of 5941 patients admitted to the ICU, 2826 (47.6%) had ACE. Patients with ACE were likely to be older, male, white, rural, and have higher comorbidities. The prevalence of ICU admission increased by 126% (p &lt; 0.01). The predictors of ACE included male sex, older age, coronary artery disease, heart failure, renal failure, and two or more comorbidities. Patients with ACE were more likely to have cardiac arrest, hemodialysis, sepsis, and shock (all p &lt; 0.01).
There has been an increase in the prevalence of critically ill SCD patients requiring ICU care, with subsequent morbidity and mortality. Further research is needed to understand the underlying factors that drive these observed trends and increase mortality rates.
The authors have confirmed clinical trial registration is not needed for this submission.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-24">摘要</h3>
<p>Erectile dysfunction (ED), traditionally considered a condition of older men, is increasingly reported among men under the age of 40, yet its prevalence in this population remains underestimated. While psychogenic factors have been considered the primary cause, ED is now recognized as a multidimensional condition with both organic and psychological aspects. Hence, this review aims to synthesize current evidence on the epidemiology, psychosocial impact, etiological factors, and management strategies of ED in the young male population. A narrative review was conducted using PubMed’s search builder, applying a combination of the following Medical Subject Headings and keywords: “Erectile Dysfunction” and “Young.” The search identified 1,981 articles, from which articles were selected based on relevance and methodological quality. The prevalence of ED in young men varies widely, with studies reporting rates as high as 35%. While psychogenic causes such as performance anxiety, depression, and relationship issues are prevalent, a significant proportion of young men also present with organic etiologies, including endothelial dysfunction, hormonal imbalances, metabolic syndrome, and neurogenic disorders. Lifestyle factors such as pornography use, poor sleep quality, dietary habits, lack of physical activity, and recreational drug use have also been independently linked with ED. Management of ED in this population requires a multidisciplinary approach that incorporates both pharmacologic treatments (e.g., phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, hormone therapy) and non-pharmacologic interventions, including lifestyle modification and cognitive-behavioral therapy. ED in young men is an increasingly prevalent and clinically complex condition that necessitates comprehensive evaluation and individualized treatment. Further research is essential to improve outcomes in this growing patient population.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-25">摘要</h3>
<p>The Korean population traditionally consumes more iodine-rich seaweeds than Western populations due to dietary culture and geographical location. However, the association between excessive iodine intake and thyroid disease remains controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the association between iodine intake and thyroid disease using the largest-scale Korean cohort data.
This study utilized data from 190,524 participants in the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study. Iodine intakes were assessed using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Iodine intake was classified into quintiles, and the association between iodine intake and the prevalence of thyroid disease was evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analysis.
Of the 190,524 participants, 8,387 (4.40%) were diagnosed with thyroid diseases by a physician. In the total population, higher iodine intake was not associated with an increased risk of thyroid disease after adjusting for confounding variables. Additionally, the odds ratio for the highest iodine intake group compared to the lowest iodine intake group was 0.89 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-1.11; P for trend = 0.7434) in men and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.85-1.00; P for trend = 0.2286) in women.
Excessive iodine consumption was not associated with thyroid disease in Korean adults. Further longitudinal studies are required to assess the long-term effects of iodine intake on thyroid disease.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-26">摘要</h3>
<p>Our study aimed to investigate the association of food group intake and the quality of diet with the risk of loss of muscle mass in Korean baby boomers using a large-scale national cohort data.
The study included 1,280 Korean baby boomers (609 men and 671 women) who were born between 1955 and 1963 and who participated in the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study from 2001 to 2018. A validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire was used to assess dietary intake. The Korean Healthy Eating Index (K-HEI) and the Mediterranean-Type Diet scores helped to evaluate the quality of the diet. Bioelectrical impedance analysis at baseline and during follow-up visits was used to measure the total muscle mass. Muscle loss was defined as a ≥ 5% decrease in total muscle mass over 2 yrs. This prospective cohort study had a mean follow-up duration of 12.7 yrs. Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratio for muscle loss on the basis of the levels of dietary variables.
In men, high grain intake was significantly associated with an increased risk of muscle loss (P for trend = 0.023). In women, a high intake of dairy products was associated with a reduced risk of muscle loss (P for trend = 0.021). Additionally, higher fruit intake and K-HEI scores were inversely associated with muscle loss when adjusted only for age and total energy intake.
Our study demonstrates gender-specific associations of diet with the loss of muscle mass in the Korean baby boomers. Although high grain intake may increase the risk of loss of muscle mass in men, high dairy intake may provide protective effects in women. These findings emphasize the need for targeted dietary strategies to prevent age-related muscle loss.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-27">摘要</h3>
<p>Over 10% of older American adults (age ≥ 65) experience cognitive impairment (CI) from Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). An additional 15%-22% experience mild cognitive impairment (MCI), often preceding ADRD and in earlier life. However, CI burden estimates including MCI and early-onset CI (age &lt; 65), remain limited.
Using microsimulation, we estimated CI burden (ADRD and/or MCI) over remaining life-years for Americans (aged 51/52) who developed CI overall, by disease progression, onset age, and sociodemographic subgroups. Burden equaled the difference in quality-adjusted life-years (QALY valued at $150K/year) and economic outcomes between a hypothetical intervention preventing CI and status quo.
Per capita lifetime CI burden was $124K, driven by lost QALYs. Aggregate CI burden was $627B, 59% from ADRD, 41% from MCI. Early-onset CI carried the largest per capita burden ($376K), ∼50% from MCI. Individuals with less education, progression to ADRD, or from minoritized racial/ethnic subgroups also carried disproportionate burden.
MCI constitutes 41% of CI burden, disproportionately impacting individuals with early-onset.
The lifetime burden of cognitive impairment (CI) was estimated at $124,000 per capita, totaling $627 billion in aggregate-with 59% attributed to Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) and 41% to mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Early-onset CI (before age 65) carried the highest per capita burden at $376,000, with these individuals living with MCI for about 13 years-over 7 years longer than those with late-onset CI. Significant disparities exist in CI burden, with racial/ethnic minorities and those without a high school degree experiencing disproportionately higher burden. Despite representing just 36% of the CI population, non-White individuals accounted for 47% of the aggregate CI burden.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-28">摘要</h3>
<p>Chronotype and ultra-processed food (UPF) intake are individually associated with metabolic risk, but their combined effect remains unclear. This study examined the interaction between chronotype and UPF intake in relation to insulin resistance, assessed by the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index.
Data were obtained from 542 adults in the Gangwon Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome (GOMS) Study. Chronotypes were classified into morning, intermediate, and evening types using Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire-based clustering. UPF intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire and classified according to the Korean-adapted NOVA classification system. Intake was expressed as a percentage of total energy and divided into quartiles. General linear models were used to examine the interaction between chronotype and UPF intake in relation to the TyG index, with adjustments for relevant covariates. An additional analysis examined the association between TyG quartiles and diabetes prevalence.
A significant interaction between UPF intake and chronotype was observed only in the evening-type group (P = 0.043). In this group, TyG values were significantly higher in Q3 and Q4 compared to Q1 (P = 0.005). The TyG index also varied significantly across chronotypes and UPF intake quartiles (P = 0.005 and P = 0.046, respectively). The odds of diabetes increased across TyG quartiles, with ORs of 3.52 (Q3) and 5.41 (Q4) compared to Q1.
The association between UPF intake and the TyG index varied by chronotype, with evening types showing greater vulnerability. These findings suggest that biological rhythms may modify the metabolic impact of diet, highlighting the need for personalized prevention strategies.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-29">摘要</h3>
<p>A survey was conducted to determine the demand for the use of digital health content for health promotion, both among those interested in using digital tools and those interested in health promotion.
This study targeted smartphone owners who attended a class on how to use a smartphone (CS) and/or a class on advancements in health (CH) held in Nanbu Town. The main questionnaire items included questions on age, gender, frailty, subjective cognitive decline (SCD), smartphone usage, and interest in health promotion using digital technology. An analysis was conducted on 33 participants in the CS and 33 participants from the CH who provided complete responses to the questionnaire.
The percentages of interest in using smartphones for accessing content on exercise, cognitive training, and nutrition management were 97.0%, 97.0%, and 87.9%, respectively, among CS participants and 69.7%, 78.8%, and 81.8%, respectively, among CH participants. The percentage of responses regarding interest in exercise content was significantly different between the two groups. Furthermore, some individuals responded that they were interested but concerned about how to use the services. No statistically significant differences were found with respect to the comparison of the percentages of responses by age group, frailty determination results, and SCD determination results among the participants of the CS and CR groups.
Regardless of age or the risk of developing health problems, there is demand for content related to health promotion using digital tools for those who want to master digital tools and who want to improve their health. However, support should be provided to them to ensure that they correctly use those tools. Notably, some individuals who want to improve their health are not interested in using digital tools.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-30">摘要</h3>
<p>To utilize the Traditional Chinese Medicine constitution (TCMC) as a complementary and alternative approach for early disease detection and treatment, with a focus on Yin and Yang deficiency constitutions, which serve as key references for disease prevention and management.
The dataset containing the data of Yin and Yang deficiency constitution was identified through the Gene Expression Omnibus database. This database was used for differential expression genes (DEGs) analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and the characteristic genes were then obtained in the dataset using a machine learning method. The hub genes of Yin and Yang deficiency constitution were obtained after analysis using the above three methods, and the hub genes were enriched and analyzed. Subsequently, the hub genes of Yin and Yang deficiency constitution were validated using external datasets. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used on each hub genes of the two groups to further understand their diagnostic performance. The miRNA-lncRNA-gene network was used to further analyze the hub genes. Immunoinfiltration and gene set enrichment analysis were performed on the shared hub genes.
The GSE87474 dataset was used for DEGs analysis and WGCNA. Using machine learning analyses, we identified 15 and 14 hub genes for Yin and Yang deficiency constitutions, respectively. The results of enrichment analyses showed that Yin deficiency constitution was associated with interleukin-17 signaling pathway, whereas Yang deficiency constitution was associated with glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis-keratan sulfate. The validation dataset GSE56116 showed statistically significant data for s-adenosylmethionine sensor upstream of MTORC1 (SAMTOR, also named C7orf60), cofilin 2 (CFL2), cytohesin 1 interacting protein (CYTIP), G protein-coupled receptor 183 (GPR183), hippocampus abundant transcript 1 (HIAT1), kelch like family member 15 (KLHL15), mitogen-activated protein kinase 6 (MAPK6), and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) in Yin deficiency and fucosy-ltransferase 8 (FUT8), TATA-box binding protein associated factor, RNA polymerase I subunit D (TAF1D), zinc finger protein 24 (ZNF24), MAPK6, and leptin receptor overlapping transcript like 1 (LEPROTL1) in Yang deficiency. The ROC results indicated that these genes have diagnostic value. MAPK6 is a shared hub gene for Yin and Yang deficiencies.
This study identified C7orf60, CFL2, CYTIP, GPR183, HIAT1, KLHL15, MAPK6, and PTGS2 in Yin deficiency and FUT8, TAF1D, ZNF24, MAPK6, and LEPROTL1 in Yang deficiency as potential biomarkers, providing insights into their pathogenesis. This theory not only guides the diagnostic approach in TCM but also extends its influence to various scientific research fields.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-31">摘要</h3>
<p>To evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of Tuomin Zhiti decoction (, TZD) in the short-term treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR).
This study is a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled, and single-center clinical trial. In April 2021, during the spring pollen season in Beijing, 94 SAR patients aged 19-60 years were randomized (1:1 ratio) to receive two weeks of TZD or placebo. The primary outcomes were the change of Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) and Total Ocular Symptom Score (TOSS) from baseline to the end of treatment. Secondary outcomes were the changed score of the mini Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ), Rescue Medication Score (RMS), and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC). All adverse events were recorded and evaluated by two senior physicians.
TZD significantly reduced both the total nasal symptom scores and total ocular symptom scores compared to scores at baseline, while the placebo group showed an increasing trajectory in both symptom scores. Compared to the placebo group, the TZD group also showed a greater improvement in the quality of life, scores of RMS, nasal and eye symptoms scores after TZD treatment (P &lt; 0.001). Most notably, at the end of treatment, the proportion of remission measured by PGIC was significantly higher in the TZD group (82.97%) compared with the placebo group (47.72%, P &lt; 0.001).
This study suggested that two weeks of TZD is an effective and safe treatment for SAR patients and spring pollen allergy, TZD could significantly improve the nasal and eye symptoms and improve the quality of life of patients.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-32">摘要</h3>
<p>The flooded soil conditions under which rice is typically grown are beneficial for boosting yield and decreasing herbicide inputs but may pose a food safety and environmental health risk. Flooded soils lead to reducing conditions and anaerobic metabolisms of soil microorganisms, which mobilizes arsenic from soil into soil solution, where it can be absorbed by rice roots and transported to grain. These conditions also promote the production and emission of methane (CH4)-a potent greenhouse gas. To evaluate how water management affects metal(loid) grain concentrations and CH4 emissions, we conducted a 2-year field study in which rice paddy water was managed under a range of soil redox conditions that spanned from flooded to non-flooded. We observed that growing rice under less flooded conditions decreased CH4 emissions and concentrations of grain total As, grain inorganic As, grain total Hg, and grain inorganic Hg relative to flooded conditions, with more reductions observed as conditions were drier; grain organic As and Hg (MeHg) species also decreased with drier conditions particularly in Year 1. However, the driest conditions tested led to a 50%-97% increase in grain Cd concentrations that exceeded the CODEX limit and grain yield reductions as high as 25% and 40% in Year 1 and 2, respectively. While concentrations of toxic metal(loid)s could be manipulated by water management, micronutrient concentrations were similar or decreased with drier conditions, potentially increasing grain Cd bioaccessibility to humans. Because practices for rice water management are gaining momentum, more research should monitor grain Cd levels along with micronutrients.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-33">摘要</h3>
<p>Oral cancer remains a significant global health challenge. Early detection is essential for improving prognostic outcomes, yet current diagnostic practices are hindered by the invasive nature of biopsies and the reliance on staining methods. This study presents a low-cost, label-free deep ultraviolet (UV) microscopy system, integrated with artificial intelligence (AI), for analyzing unstained cytology specimens. Leveraging the absorption properties of nuclei under UV light, this technology produces high-resolution molecular images, enabling real-time, automated, and objective analysis of cellular and nuclear morphology. Forty patients with oral lesions-spanning benign, oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMD), and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC)-participated in this study. Cytology nuclei were segmented using a deep learning-based U-Net architecture, and key nuclear features, including intensity, solidity, eccentricity, and axis ratio, were extracted and analyzed. These features demonstrated high sensitivity (&gt;80%) and specificity (&gt;79%) in distinguishing diagnostic groups. Furthermore, unsupervised clustering based on these features effectively classified patient cohorts, underscoring its potential for early diagnosis. The proposed method eliminates the need for staining, reduces processing time, and minimizes environmental impact, making it particularly suited for primary healthcare settings. By integrating advanced imaging with AI, this scalable approach addresses critical gaps in early oral cancer detection, offering significant potential to improve patient outcomes. Validation in larger and more diverse cohorts is required to enhance its clinical utility.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-34">摘要</h3>
<p>Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of global mortality. Different blood pressure subtypes may have varying associations with cardiovascular events, but evidence remains inconclusive in the working population. The objective of the study was to evaluate the incidence and differences between hypertension and prehypertension subtypes in the development of cardiovascular events in an occupational cohort.
A retrospective cohort study including 12,027 workers monitored over 8 years. The outcome variable was the development of CVD, including myocardial infarction and/or stroke. Hypertension subtypes were classified as normotension (systolic blood pressure (SBP) &lt; 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &lt; 90 mm Hg), isolated systolic hypertension (SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg and DBP &lt; 90 mm Hg), isolated diastolic hypertension (SBP &lt; 140 mm Hg and DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg), and systolic-diastolic hypertension (SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg and DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg). Prehypertension subtypes were defined as isolated systolic prehypertension (SBP 120 - 139 mm Hg and DBP &lt; 80 mm Hg), isolated diastolic prehypertension (SBP &lt; 120 mm Hg and DBP 80 - 89 mm Hg), and systolic-diastolic prehypertension (SBP 120 - 139 mm Hg and DBP 80 - 89 mm Hg). Cox models were used to estimate crude hazard ratios (cHRs) and adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs), controlling for sociodemographic variables and cardiovascular risk factors.
Isolated systolic hypertension (aHR: 6.78, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.10 - 14.8) and isolated systolic prehypertension (aHR: 3.42, 95% CI: 1.73 - 6.74) showed significant associations with cardiovascular events, even after adjusting for confounding variables. Neither isolated diastolic nor systolic-diastolic prehypertension and hypertension showed significant associations.
While cardiovascular events were infrequent in this occupational cohort, those that occurred showed significant associations with both systolic hypertension and pre-systolic hypertension, suggesting the importance of systolic pressure monitoring in workplace health surveillance.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-37">摘要</h3>
<p>Background Down syndrome (DS) is one of the most common chromosomal anomalies, affecting a substantial number of newborns globally. Pediatric patients with DS face a range of health challenges, including complex and often underrecognized pain experiences. These children may exhibit atypical responses to pain, such as reduced verbal expression, behavioral changes (e.g., freezing), or lower pain thresholds, that can render conventional pain assessment strategies insufficient. Consequently, there is a critical need for multidimensional tools specifically tailored to the characteristics of this vulnerable population. This study aims to develop and validate a novel mixed-methods instrument - the ANDREAS tool - designed to accurately assess acute pain in children with DS by integrating behavioral observations with self-report measures, where feasible. Methods A mixed-methods approach will be employed to adapt a pain assessment scale suitable for children with DS, combining behavioral observations with self-reported measures when possible. Pain-related behaviors will be identified through an extensive literature review and focus group discussions involving researchers, parents, and healthcare professionals. Additional methodological components will include defined randomization procedures for participant selection, clear inclusion and exclusion criteria, a standardized venipuncture protocol to induce pain, and a tailored training program for assessors to ensure methodological rigor. The resulting instrument, ANDREAS, will undergo validation using exploratory factor analysis and internal consistency testing (Cronbach’s alpha). Results The study is expected to yield a validated tool capable of capturing both the presence and severity of acute pain in pediatric patients with DS. Key behavioral indicators, such as freezing, defined as the absence of movement for at least five seconds during a painful stimulus, will be operationalized and assessed using a structured 0-4 rating scale. The integration of behavioral and self-report data is anticipated to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of pain detection in this population. Conclusions The ANDREAS instrument is expected to provide a reliable, valid, and clinically meaningful method for assessing acute pain in children with DS. By combining behavioral observations with self-report, it introduces a novel, multidimensional approach that may improve the accuracy of pain evaluation and inform more effective clinical management strategies. Future research will focus on further validating the instrument’s psychometric properties and exploring its use across diverse clinical settings.</p>

<p>Acrochordons are benign skin neoplasms that originate from mesenchymal and ectodermal tissues. These lesions are commonly found in regions of the skin that experience friction or folding. This report presents a 48-year-old female patient who exhibited a 3 cm acrochordon located on the right labia majora of her vulva. A thorough review of her medical history did not reveal any identifiable risk factors that could account for the onset and rapid growth of the polyp. A wide surgical excision was conducted, and the subsequent histopathological examination confirmed a polypoid proliferation of the stroma, accompanied by a hypocellular stroma composed of spindle cells and loose collagenous stroma. At the six-month follow-up, the patient showed no signs of recurrence.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-39">摘要</h3>
<p>Orthopedic disabilities are a significant public health challenge in rural areas, where access to rehabilitation and support services is often inadequate. Individuals with physical disabilities frequently lack the necessary awareness, resources, and community support to manage their conditions effectively.
This comparative study aims to evaluate a community-based survivorship model (CBSM) for individuals with orthopedic disabilities in rural areas. The model focuses on educating patients, fostering positive health behaviors, and providing a structured framework for managing disability-related challenges.
A study was conducted using primary data. A total of 156 participants meeting inclusion criteria were randomly allocated to intervention (n = 78) and control (n = 78) groups. The intervention group received the CBSM for three months, comprising six components: rehabilitation, prosthetics/orthotics, mental health support, health campaigns, occupational therapy, and financial aid. Outcomes were assessed pre- and post-intervention using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Self-Efficacy Scale, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Data were analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 26 (Released 2020; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States).
The experimental group demonstrated markedly greater improvements compared to the control group. Pain scores (VAS) decreased by a mean difference of 2.56 (p &lt; 0.001), functional independence (FIM) increased by 11.11 (p &lt; 0.001), and self-efficacy improved by 8.71 (p &lt; 0.001). Additionally, depressive symptoms (PHQ-9) reduced substantially with a mean difference of 6.15 (p &lt; 0.001).
The CBSM provides an effective, structured strategy to enhance functional independence, self-efficacy, and mental well-being while reducing pain among individuals with orthopedic disabilities in rural settings.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-40">摘要</h3>
<p>Cutaneous nocardiosis is an uncommon but clinically significant opportunistic infection, primarily affecting immunocompromised individuals, including those with underlying malignancies, organ transplants, or chronic corticosteroid use. Although it can also occur in elderly patients, this is often due to age-associated immunosenescence or comorbid conditions that impair immune function. We describe a case of lymphocutaneous Nocardia brasiliensis infection in an 87-year-old man with no history of trauma or corticosteroid use. The patient had been receiving long-term low-dose methotrexate (MTX) for rheumatoid arthritis. He presented with painful, erythematous nodules arranged along the lymphatic vessels of the right forearm. Histopathological analysis and culture confirmed the diagnosis. Oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and minocycline were initiated; minocycline was discontinued after three weeks due to gastrointestinal symptoms. MTX was also stopped in response to clinical progression. The lesions resolved completely with continued TMP-SMX monotherapy over a three-month course. A brief review of the literature revealed only a few reported cases of cutaneous nocardiosis in individuals over 85 years of age. Some of these lacked clear immunosuppressive backgrounds or trauma history. While TMP-SMX remains the standard therapy, its use in older adults may be constrained by tolerability. This case serves as a reminder that Nocardia infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of nodular skin lesions in very elderly patients, even in the absence of typical risk factors.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-41">摘要</h3>
<p>Different methods for describing health disparities in the distributions of continuous measured health-related variables among groups provide more insight into the nature and impact of the disparities than comparing measures of central tendency. Transformations of the Lorenz curve and analogues of the Gini index used in the analysis of income inequality are adapted to provide graphical and analytical measures of health disparities. Akin to the classical Peters-Belson regression method for partitioning a disparity into a component explained by group differences in a set of covariates and an unexplained component, a new modified Lorenz curve is proposed. The estimation of these curves/measures is adapted for data obtained from surveys with complex sample weighted designs. The statistical properties of sample weighted estimators of the proposed measures and their bootstrap variances are explored through simulation studies. Applications are demonstrated using BMI and blood lead levels among race/ethnic groups of adult females and children, respectively, from the 2013-2018 and 1988-1994 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. Another application examines disparities in distance to nearest acute care hospital among census blocks in the US state of New York grouped by their level of urbanicity using US census data and the American Hospital Association survey.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-42">摘要</h3>
<p>The increasing resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to existing antimalarial drugs drives the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies. The purine salvage pathway in P. falciparum is essential for the parasite’s survival due to its complete reliance on host-derived purines for nucleic acid synthesis and other essential processes. Although the purine salvage system has been intensively researched, no purine-based antimalarial drugs have been taken into preclinical development. The current study evaluated the chemotherapeutic potential of some purine nucleobase analogues against P. falciparum.
In vitro sensitivity assays were conducted using the 72-hour SYBR Green drug assay on laboratory-adapted P. falciparum strains 3D7 and Dd2. The most potent nucleobase analogues were docked into PfENT1 using the PyRx software suite.
The analogues 8-azaguanine, 7-deazaguanine, and 6-thioguanine exhibited average EC50 values of 1.71 µM, 14.9 µM and 15.7 µM, respectively, for 3D7 and 5.2 µM, 16.3 µM and 18.6 µM, respectively, for the Dd2 strain, and subsequently tested against field isolates of P. falciparum. These ex vivo tests showed EC50 values ranging from 0.5 - 4.5 µM for 8-azaguanine, 3.8 - 12.3 µM for 7-deazaguanine, and 4.1 - 15.0 µM for 6-thioguanine. To understand their cellular targeting, molecular docking of the same analogues was performed using the structure of P. falciparum Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1 (PfENT1). This demonstrated that guanine, 8-azaguanine and 7-deazaguanine formed five hydrogen bonds each with the same amino acid residues of PfENT1, whereas 6-thioguanine’s orientation allowed only two hydrogen bonds with PfENT1. The binding pose of inosine was different from these nucleobases.
These findings highlight the potential of guanine-based scaffolds, particularly 8-azaguanine and 7-deazaguanine, as promising leads for purine-based antimalarial drug development and the versatility of the PfENT1 transporter in the uptake of purine antimetabolites.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-43">摘要</h3>
<p>Epidemic intelligence, the process of detecting, verifying, and analyzing public health threats to enable timely responses, traditionally relies heavily on manual reporting and structured data, often causing delays and coverage gaps. The growing frequency of emerging infectious diseases highlights the urgency for more rapid and accurate surveillance methods. This perspective proposes a forward-looking conceptual framework for AI-driven epidemic intelligence, emphasizing the transformative potential of integrating large language models (LLMs), natural language processing (NLP), and optimization-based resource allocation strategies. While existing AI-driven systems have shown significant capabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic, several challenges remain, including real-time adaptability, multilingual data handling, misinformation, and public health policy alignment. To address these gaps, we propose an integrated, real-time adaptable LLM-based epidemic intelligence system, capable of correlating cross-source data, optimizing healthcare resource allocation, and supporting informed outbreak response. This approach aims to significantly improve early warning capabilities, enhancing forecasting accuracy, and strengthen pandemic preparedness.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-44">摘要</h3>
<p>Adolescent depression is a crucial determinant of an individual’s developmental trajectories and long-term health-related quality of life. Romantic relationships are widely recognized as a risk factor of adolescent depression. Peer norms, as an important source of social influence in adolescence, have the potential to moderate the effects of romantic relationships. The present study aims to examine the moderating effects of peer norms, including descriptive norms and injunctive norms, on the association between romantic relationships and adolescent depression in China.
The present study used a nationally representative sample of 6718 junior high school students from the China Education Panel Survey (CEPS). The ordinary least squares regression model was used to assess both the main effects of romantic relationships on adolescent depression and the moderating effects of peer norms. The bounding approach was used for sensitivity analysis.
Romantic relationships were positively associated with adolescent depression (β=0.290, p&lt;.001). Descriptive norms, including class norms (β=-0.634, p=.042) and friend norms (β=-0.206, p&lt;.001), significantly mitigate the association between romantic relationships and adolescent depression, but injunctive norms (β=0.253, p=.035) significantly exacerbate the association. The sensitivity analysis reveals that the above results are robust to the potential confounding impact of unobserved variables.
Peer norms were found to significantly moderate the correlation between romantic relationships and adolescent depression. It is important to play the role of descriptive and injunctive peer norms in the prevention and intervention for the depression of adolescents, especially for those who are in a romantic relationship.</p>

<p>This study addresses the mental health needs of refugees and migrants in the Netherlands, highlighting the urgent public health challenges they face. Unique psychosocial hurdles, exacerbated by cultural dislocation, language barriers and systemic inequalities, hinder their access to quality mental healthcare. This study explores how coloniality intersects with mental healthcare access, using a decolonial framework to challenge stereotypes and assumptions that marginalize migrant voices. Through semi-structured interviews with migrants and language service providers, this research reveals the complexities of navigating the mental healthcare system. Findings reveal that temporality, professionalism and language barriers are key issues in migrants’ mental healthcare journeys. We advocate for systemic changes that prioritize migrant perspectives. Ultimately, this study aims to inform policy and practice to enhance mental health services for migrant populations in the Netherlands and contribute to the broader dialogue on decolonization in mental health.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-46">摘要</h3>
<p>Syrian refugees in Türkiye show a high prevalence of mental health problems but encounter barriers to accessing mental health services. Group Problem Management Plus (gPM+), developed by the World Health Organization, is a low-intensity psychological intervention delivered by nonspecialist facilitators. This qualitative process evaluation explores the acceptability, feasibility and perceived effectiveness of gPM+ for Syrian refugees resettled in Türkiye, as well as facilitating factors and barriers to its implementation. Twenty-three semi-structured interviews were conducted with gPM+ participants, facilitators, drop-outs, relatives of participants and key informants. Findings showed that gPM+ was well-received for its group-based format, which participants felt fostered social support, and for its content, which they reported may have led to improvements in coping skills and family relationships. Facilitators viewed the intervention as feasible to implement. However, barriers such as participants’ economic struggles, practical challenges (e.g., childcare and transportation difficulties) and low mental health literacy impeded engagement. Adapting gPM+ to address social determinants like poverty may be beneficial. The need for booster sessions was emphasized to maintain long-term change and provide deeper learning of the strategies. For sustainable scaling up gPM+ within primary health care, key informants highlighted the importance of training and supervising nonprofessional facilitators and securing governmental support.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-47">摘要</h3>
<p>Studies investigating genotoxic effects of radiofrequency electromagnetic field (RF-EMF) exposure (3 kHz-300 GHz) have used a wide variety of parameters, and results have been inconsistent. A systematic mapping of existing research is necessary to identify emerging patterns and to inform future research and policy.
Evidence mapping was conducted using guidance from the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). A comprehensive search strategy was applied across multiple research databases, using specific inclusion and exclusion criteria within each knowledge domain. Quantitative aggregation using tables, graphs and heat maps was used to synthesize data according to study type, organism type, exposure level and duration, biological markers (genotoxicity, cellular stress, apoptosis), RF-EMF signal characteristics, as well as funding source to further contextualize the evidence landscape. Quality criteria were applied as part of a focused analysis to explore potential biases and their effects on outcomes.
Over 500 pertinent studies were identified, categorized as in vitro (53%), in vivo (37%), and epidemiological (10%), and grouped according to type of DNA damage, organism, intensity, duration, signal characteristics, biological markers and funding source. In vitro studies predominantly showed proportionally fewer significant effects, while in vivo and epidemiological studies showed more. DNA base damage studies showed the highest proportion of effects, as did studies using GSM talk-mode, pulsed signals and real-world devices. A complex relationship was identified between exposure intensity and duration, with duration emerging as a critical determinant of outcomes. A complex U-shaped dose-response relationship was evident, suggesting adaptive cellular responses, with increased free radical production as a plausible mechanism. Higher-quality studies showed fewer significant effects; however, the funding source had a stronger influence on outcomes than study quality. Over half (58%) of studies observing DNA damage used exposures below the International Commission of Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) limits.
The collective evidence reveals that RF-EMF exposures may be genotoxic and could pose a cancer risk. Exposure duration and real-world signals are the most important factors influencing genotoxicity, warranting further focused research. To address potential genotoxic risks, these findings support the adoption of precautionary measures alongside existing thermal-based exposure guidelines.</p>

<p>This study aims to investigate the demand for childcare services for infants aged 0-3 years among the childbearing population in China and identify its key determinants.
An online survey was conducted in Suzhou, China in August 2024 using a self-designed questionnaire. Information on personal and family characteristics, as well as demand for childcare services, was collected. Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and binary logistic regression were used to analyze the determinants of childcare services.
Of 5,567 respondents, 45.9% expressed demand for childcare services for children aged 0-3 years. Binary logistic regression identified several significant predictors of demand. Notably, female gender, older age, rural residence, and lower educational attainment were associated with lower demand (p &lt; 0.05). Conversely, having more children, greater trust in childcare institutions, better knowledge about childcare services, and greater awareness of childcare policies were significantly associated with higher demand (p &lt; 0.05).
Demand for childcare services was influenced by multiple factors. Enhancing subsidies and rural service accessibility, strengthening institutional credibility, implementing incentives for multi-child families, disseminating childcare knowledge and policy information and facilitating a childcare paradigm shift were recommended.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-49">摘要</h3>
<p>Adenoviral infections significantly impact pediatric health, manifesting as respiratory, gastrointestinal, and ocular disorders. We report a 14-year-old male with adenoviral pharyngoconjunctival fever (PCF) complicated by subconjunctival hemorrhage and enlarged adenoids. The patient presented with high-grade fever, sore throat, bilateral conjunctivitis, and gastrointestinal symptoms, including vomiting and diarrhea. Initial laboratory findings suggested septicemia; however, an extended respiratory panel confirmed adenoviral infection. Notably, the patient also had left-sided undescended testes and scoliosis, raising questions about potential associations. This case underscores the complexity of adenoviral infections in children, highlighting the interplay of respiratory, gastrointestinal, and ocular symptoms. The presence of additional conditions warrants further investigation into possible correlations with adenoviral infection. Comprehensive evaluation is crucial for accurate diagnosis and management of adenoviral infections in pediatric patients, and future research should explore long-term implications and associations with cryptorchidism and scoliosis.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-50">摘要</h3>
<p>Walking is a fundamental and accessible physical activity (PA) for older adults. Using daily step counts to self-monitor adherence to the World Health Organization’s (WHO) PA guidelines may facilitate health promotion and promote behavioral changes. This study aimed to determine the step count equivalents for achieving 30 min/day and 150 min/week of moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) among older adults in Taiwan.
This cross-sectional study was conducted from May to August 2023. Community-dwelling adults aged ≥65 years were recruited through convenience sampling from local communities in northern Taiwan, with support from community leaders and activity centers. Participants were required to be capable of walking independently. Daily step counts and MVPA were measured using triaxial accelerometers. Linear regression models, including log-transformed step counts and MVPA, were used to assess equivalence.
In total, 191 older adults participated in the study (42 males, 149 females). Engaging in 30 min of MVPA daily translated to approximately 8,602 steps/day for males and 8,940 steps/day for females. Weekly MVPA of 150 min was equivalent to approximately 56,028 steps/week for males, 58,988 steps/week for females, and 57,000 steps/week overall (or 8,142 steps/day).
Among older adults, reaching at least 8,602 steps/day is a good indicator of meeting the WHO’s recommendation of 30 min/day MVPA, whereas 57,000 steps/week corresponds to 150 min/week of MVPA. These step-based thresholds provide practical and easy-to-understand targets for self-monitoring daily activity levels and offer a behavioral foundation for PA promotion strategies aimed at improving the health of aging populations.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-51">摘要</h3>
<p>To detect factors capable of predicting the development of macular edema (ME) throughout the disease course in patients affected by non-infectious uveitis (NIU).
Predictive factors leading to the development of ME were analyzed through regression analysis. The functional impact of ME on best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was also examined.
A total of 1,160 NIU patients (1,857 eyes) were analyzed. ME was observed in 148 (12.76%), affecting 211 eyes. It was significantly more frequent in patients with non-anterior NIU (p &lt; 0.0001, RR = 4.01), retinal vasculitis (p &lt; 0.0001), and other structural complications (p = 0.0005). Gender, HLA-B<em>27 and/or HLA-B</em>51 positivity, and ethnicity did not show any significant impact on the prevalence of ME (p = 0.635, p = 0.372, p = 0.193, respectively). Four variables were associated with ME development during NIU course: the non-anterior anatomical pattern (p &lt; 0.0001, OR = 4.01), the presence of retinal vasculitis (p = 0.028, OR = 1.68), complications other than ME (p = 0.044, OR = 1.51) and immunosuppressive treatment (p = 0.010, OR 1.69) while the diagnosis of Behçet disease-related uveitis was less likely to be associated with ME development (p = 0.24, OR 0.545). Mean ± SD BCVA was significantly lower in eyes with ME (0.82 ± 0.30) compared to eyes without ME (0.71 ± 0.33).
ME can develop across all NIU types, but is more likely in cases involving the posterior segment and retinal vasculitis. Regular and focused monitoring is recommended for these high-risk patients. The study also highlights the limited predictive value of demographic and HLA-related factors, helping refine clinical risk stratification and predictive modeling in NIU.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-52">摘要</h3>
<p>Over the last 20 years, increased life expectancy has been observed in men and women, resulting in a rise in the prevalence of diseases among the aging population. From this, sarcopenia has an estimated prevalence of 10%-16% of older people worldwide. Losing strength and muscle mass in the 65-70 age group represents a significant public health problem. In this review, we emphasize the essential importance of strength training in managing sarcopenia, highlighting the role of microRNAs, small nucleotides that were the subject of last year’s Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. These microRNAs regulate protein synthesis and are present in all biological fluids. Some of them are expressed differently by subjects affected by sarcopenia (as happens in various forms of cancer or other diseases). Therefore, monitoring a specific signature of microRNAs can better clarify the etiopathology of sarcopenia, providing an early biomarker for sarcopenia (currently, there are some hypotheses, but none is well recognized), and even serve as the basis for the development of drugs.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-53">摘要</h3>
<p>There is growing awareness of the environmental presence of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and their harmful effects on animals and humans. Recent studies have revealed changes in human embryonic stem cells and maternal biomarkers, underscoring the severity and unpredictable outcomes associated with long-term exposure to PFAS. Monitoring efforts continually identify additional PFAS compounds worldwide, but a standardized and unified approach is still lacking. Traditional treatment methods such as adsorption and membrane filtration have been effective in removing 80-95% of PFAS from wastewater. However, complete removal of short-chain PFAS remains limited to a few recently developed techniques. The inability of advanced treatment methods to eliminate emerging short-chain and ultrashort-chain PFAS suggests the need for more integrated approaches that target all PFAS classes. Additionally, a few studies have discussed the potential toxicity outcomes of these treatments at both laboratory and full-scale levels. While advanced oxidative processes (AOPs) are rapidly gaining attention for degrading 90-100% of PFAS in sewage, it remains challenging to fully break down PFAS into non-toxic, mineralized products such as CO2 and H2O due to the strong C-F bonds and the potential toxicity of by-products in post-treated wastewater. Standardized and reliable bioassays for assessing PFAS toxicity are still under development, and current predictive models linking molecular structure to human health effects are at an early stage. This review examines the emerging health and ecological risks associated with both legacy and novel PFAS, alongside recent advances and limitations in individual and combined treatment technologies for water and wastewater. Emphasis is placed on the potential toxicity of degradation products, highlighting the need for more integrated and comprehensive toxicity assessments to guide safer PFAS remediation strategies.

<h3 id="摘要-54">摘要</h3>
<p>Low-cost particle monitors have been widely evaluated in laboratory and ambient monitoring settings, but we have less knowledge about their performance for long-term indoor and outdoor monitoring in residential settings. We seek to provide practical guidance for using a type of low-cost particle monitors that have become widespread for indoor and outdoor monitoring in community field studies, PurpleAir PA-II monitors. We base our insights on experiences in a community-led residential field study in and around homes of predominantly agricultural workers in California’s San Joaquin Valley. Our guidance spans three categories: (1) providing tools for handling and merging disparate data structures resulting from Wi-Fi-transmitted data and data collected on onboard microSD cards, (2) assessing performance metrics of PA-II monitors from laboratory co-location and field measurements, and (3) assessing data collection success rates of Wi-Fi data transmission and microSD card data acquisition from our study locations. The post-processing methods we demonstrate can successfully align data from both Wi-Fi transmission and microSD cards. Laboratory co-location measurements demonstrated that &gt; 90% of the tested monitors performed well relative to each other (high precision), with only a few problematic monitors that warranted further investigation or exclusion from use. The application of co-location factors generated using the mean of all co-located monitors as a reference did not significantly affect distributions of field-measured indoor or outdoor PM2.5 concentrations. Relying solely on Wi-Fi data transmission in our study would have resulted in large data loss (i.e., &lt; 50% success rate); using microSD card storage with PA-II-SD monitors increased the data collection success rate to over 80% in these settings. This work contributes to the growing body of knowledge on low-cost particle sensor performance and usability.

<h3 id="摘要-55">摘要</h3>
<p>The concept of multisectoral coordination has been comprehensively described in multiple internationally recognized frameworks. However, the institutionalization of the concept is highly complex and requires further exploration. During the 8th Biennial Regional Conference of the Eastern Mediterranean Public Health Network (EMPHNET), a roundtable session brought together a panel of global and regional experts in multisectoral coordination to share knowledge and expertise, regarding the concept of multisectoral coordination, and the implementation and formalization of coordination mechanisms within national structures, particularly in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR). Discussions also addressed the challenges associated with effective multisectoral coordination, along with proposed solutions and lessons learned from past public health events. The findings of the roundtable emphasized the importance of multisectoral coordination in addressing multifaceted public health events. Multisectoral coordination was described as the “master key” for tackling complex issues at the human-animal-environmental interface. The functionality of coordination within national structures during peacetime was deemed essential for its operationality during emergencies. Therefore, panelists recommended adopting a systematic approach to emergency coordination which includes identifying sector leaders, identifying the main coordination activities, exercising plans and continuous quality improvement. Additionally, the purpose of coordination should be clearly identified and articulated alongside the shared benefits for improved engagement of relevant sectors. Several challenges to effective coordination were identified, along with corresponding solutions. These included limited operational effectiveness of coordination mechanisms during peacetime, lack of awareness regarding the importance of coordination, limited trust and co-ownership within and between organizations, and competing priorities and conflicts of interest.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-56">摘要</h3>
<p>Metabolic syndrome poses a serious public health concern among working adults, especially in the context of increasing rates of obesity and hypertension. These lifestyle-related conditions are intricately linked to sleep patterns, dietary behaviors, and physical activity.
This study aimed to examine how sleep duration, energy intake, and physical activity levels-key lifestyle factors-are associated with metabolic syndrome based on the presence or absence of obesity and hypertension among working Korean adults.
We analyzed 6,503 working Korean adults aged 20-59 years using cross-sectional data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey covering 2016-2018. This study divided the participants based on their obesity and hypertension status. We assessed the participants’ sleep duration on weekdays and weekends, their total dietary energy consumption and macronutrient intake using a 24-h dietary recall method conducted by trained interviewers, and occupational and recreational physical activities, and movement levels in MET min/week. We evaluated metabolic syndrome components using standard criteria and examined between-group differences using two-way analysis of variance and Bonferroni post-hoc tests.
Individuals with hypertension had significantly shorter weekday sleep (p &lt; 0.05) and weekend sleep durations (p &lt; 0.001) than those without. The highest total energy intake was significantly higher in obese individuals with hypertension than in those without hypertension (p &lt; 0.05) and non-obese individuals with hypertension (p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, obese individuals with hypertension showed higher levels of occupational vigorous and total physical activities than those without hypertension (p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively), whereas no difference was observed between obese and non-obese individuals with hypertension.
This study concludes that hypertension and obesity may reinforce each other through reduced sleep duration, lower physical activity levels, and increased energy intake, thereby exacerbating metabolic syndrome. To prevent metabolic syndrome in working adults, multiple aspects of sleep, nutrition, and physical activity that match their unique risk profiles must be considered.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-57">摘要</h3>
<p>This study systematically assess the potential impact of various environmental pollutants as chemical, airborne, and heavy metal on ovarian function in women, focusing on ovarian reserve such as anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and antral follicle count (AFC) as well as hormone levels like follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol (E2). By reviewing epidemiological evidence, this research aims to elucidate the reproductive toxicity of these pollutants and provide scientific support for public health policy to protect reproductive health in women of childbearing age.
Following the PRISMA-P guidelines, a comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases to include all relevant studies up to July 30, 2024. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach were used to assess study quality.
This study ultimately included 40 cohort study reports derived from 33 distinct studies that analyzed the effects of 20 pollutant types on ovarian function. Results indicate that pollutants, such as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), phthalates (PAEs), triclosan, Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs), PM2.5, and SOX, have a significantly negative impact on ovarian function, especially among younger women (&lt;35 years). Long-term exposure to particulate matter (PM)2.5 and PM10 is associated with a substantial decrease in ovarian reserve, while heavy metals (e.g., lead and cadmium) also demonstrate reproductive toxicity. However, these conclusions require validation due to both methodological limitations in the original studies (e.g., heterogeneous exposure assessments and residual confounding) and challenges in evidence synthesis (e.g., inconsistent outcome measures across cohorts), highlighting the need for further research to address these constraints.
This review underscores that specific pollutants (e.g., PCBs, PFAS, PM) pose substantial risks to reproductive health in women of childbearing age, particularly in highly polluted environments. The findings underscore the importance of regular ovarian health monitoring, especially for women at higher risk due to occupational or environmental factors.

<h3 id="摘要-58">摘要</h3>
<p>This study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the global burden of temperature-related ischemic heart disease from 1990 to 2021, analyzing the temporal trends and regional disparities stratified by socioeconomic development levels. Furthermore, we identified high-risk populations and mapped the trajectory of disease burden up to 2050 to generate data that will inform the establishment of evidence-based public health interventions and climate adaptation strategies.
A comprehensive analysis was conducted on data derived from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 (GBD 2021) to determine the impact of temperature-related ischemic heart disease burden in 204 countries and territories. Primary outcome measures included absolute mortality counts, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs). In addition, temporal trend analysis was conducted using joinpoint regression to identify significant inflection points and calculate the annual percent change (APC) estimates. The future landscape of changes in mortality up to 2050 was predicted using the Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) modeling approach, while accounting for age-specific, period-specific, and birth cohort effects. Socioeconomic stratification was performed using the Sociodemographic Index (SDI) quintiles to compare and characterize the variations in the disease burden across development levels. Data uncertainty was quantified using Monte Carlo simulation methods, and the results were expressed as point estimates and their corresponding 95% uncertainty intervals (UI) to ensure robust statistical inference.
In 2021, high-temperature exposure contributed to 112,389 IHD deaths globally (95% UI: 17,052-256,434), reflecting a 345.0% increase compared to baseline levels in 1990. The corresponding age-standardized mortality rate increased by 1.34 per 10,000, with an estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) of 1.67 (95% CI: 0.61-2.73). The analysis identified marked sex-specific disparities, characterized by a 41.6% (risk ratio: 1.416, 95% CI not provided) higher mortality risk in males relative to females and a male-to-female DALYs ratio of 1.667. In contrast, low non-optimal temperature was associated with 505,298 IHD deaths globally (95% UI: 432,024-619,922), which represented a 64.4% increase in absolute numbers since 1990 (EAPC: 1.09, 95% CI: 0.77-1.40). In contrast, age-standardized mortality rates decreased by 36.9% annually (EAPC: -2.61, 95% CI: -2.73 to -2.48), indicating improved population-level resilience despite the growing absolute burden. Significant socioeconomic disparities were observed, with low-to-middle SDI regions bearing a disproportionate share (75.0%) of the global high non-optimal temperature-related mortality burden. Geographically, North Africa and the Middle East recorded the highest rates (5.97 per 100,000 population), while high-SDI regions demonstrated a sustained annual decline of 6.8% in age-standardized mortality rates linked to low non-optimal temperature. Analysis of the Bayesian modeling projections for 2050 revealed divergent trajectories: high non-optimal temperature-related age-standardized death rates and DALYs rates are likely to increase by 2.85 per 100,000 and 66.83 per 100,000, respectively. In contrast, age-standardized mortality rates associated with low non-optimal temperature are anticipated to decrease by 6.08 per 100,000, reflecting continued adaptation and improved healthcare infrastructure.
Non-optimal temperature exposure exerts differential effects on the global IHD mortality burden. Moreover, disease risks linked to high non-optimal temperatures are exacerbated with anthropogenic climate change, which necessitates the formulation of targeted occupational health interventions and enhanced healthcare infrastructure, particularly in low-resource settings. Conversely, while low non-optimal temperature-related mortality risks exhibited a declining age-standardized rates, the growing absolute burden attributable to population aging and persistent energy inequities underscores the need for continued surveillance and intervention. Finally, the disproportionate effect on socioeconomically disadvantaged regions highlights the urgent need for climate-health equity initiatives.</p>

<p>Pneumoconiosis is the most serious and common occupational disease in China. This study aimed to analyze the factors influencing participation in pulmonary rehabilitation among patients with pneumoconiosis and provide a basis for decision-making to promote their engagement in rehabilitation.
We collected data from patients with complete file information between January 2020 and December 2023. The basic information, disease stage, and other characteristics were analyzed. SPSS (version 22.0) statistical software was used for the chi-square test, U-test, and logistic regression analysis.
A total of 1994 patients with pneumoconiosis were included in this study. Of these, 77.8% of the patients participated in rehabilitation and 22.2% did not take part. Comparisons between the two groups revealed that the average annual hospitalization times, hospitalization expenditure, patient income, family expenditure, and disability level in the rehabilitation group were higher than in the non-rehabilitation group (p &lt; 0.05). There were statistical differences in household nature, education level, employment status, disease stage, complications, and smoking composition (p &lt; 0.05). Logistic regression analysis indicated that patients with urban household registration, smoking history, and complications were less likely to participate in rehabilitation. Conversely, individuals with a higher educational level, advanced disease stage, annual hospitalization expenditure and family expenditure, as well as retired patients were more likely to participate in rehabilitation.
The participation of patients with pneumoconiosis is influenced by various factors, including their household registration nature, educational level, and disease stage. Additional measures should be taken to improve the patients’ motivation for rehabilitation.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-61">摘要</h3>
<p>Violence is a major public health problem, which increased during the Covid-19 pandemic, affecting the physical and mental development of adolescents.
To analyze factors associated with interpersonal violence and depressive symptoms in adolescent students in the South of Jalisco.
Data were drawn from an online survey of 3,046 adolescents (12-19 years) conducted between September and December 2021. The Beck Depression Inventory was used to assess depressive symptoms. Self-report of neglect, physical, psychological, sexual, and digital violence in the previous 12 months were analyzed. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models explored factors associated with depression and violence.
A total of 28.8% of the sample reported depressive symptoms, 46.9% physical violence, 42.7% psychological violence, 34.9% neglect, 12.3% digital violence, and 5.2% sexual violence. The odds of depression were higher for those who experienced physical violence (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=1.3 CI95% [1.1-1.6]), psychological and (aOR=4.1 CI95% [3.4-5.1]), digital violence (aOR=2.0 CI95% [1.5-2.5]); and neglect (aOR=1.6 CI95% [1.3-1.9]). Grils and adolescents aged 15-19 years, had higher odds of experiencing sexual, digital, and psychological violence. Poor school performance was associated with lower odds of reporting neglect (aOR=0.6 CI95% [0.5-0.8]) and sexual violence (aOR=0.5 CI95% [0.3-0.8]), while being employed was associated with reporting higher odds of physical violence (aOR=1.5 CI95% [1.3-1.8]) and neglect (aOR=1.3 CI95% [1.1-1.5]). Greater use of social networks and videogames was associated with higher odds of physical, psychological, and digital violence.
It is necessary to implement comprehensive public programs and policies to address violence and implement intersectoral social intervention strategies in mental health.
La violencia es un problema de salud pública de gran magnitud, que aumentó durante la pandemia de Covid-19 y tiene consecuencias en el desarrollo físico y mental de los adolescentes.
Analizar factores asociados de violencia interpersonal y síntomas depresivos en estudiantes adolescentes del Sur de Jalisco.
Datos provienen de una encuesta en línea entre 3,046 adolescentes (de 12 a 19 años) realizada entre septiembre y diciembre de 2021. Se utilizó el Inventario de Beck para evaluar los síntomas depresivos. Se midieron autoreporte de negligencia, violencia física, psicológica, sexual y digital en los últimos 12 meses. Los modelos de regresión logística bivariados y multivariados exploraron factores asociados con depresión y violencia.
El 28.8% de la muestra refirió síntomas depresivos, 46.9% violencia física, 42.7% violencia psicológica, 34.9% negligencia; 12.3% violencia digital y 5.2% violencia sexual. Las probabilidades de depresión fueron mayores para aquellos que experimentaron violencia física (Razón de Momios ajustado [RMa]=1.3 IC95% [1.1–1.6]), psicológica y (RMa=4.1 IC95% [3.4–5.1]), violencia digital (RMa=2.0 IC95% [1.5–2.5]); y negligencia (RMa=1.6 IC95% [1.3–1.9]). Ser mujer y adolescentes de 15 a 19 años tuvieron mayores probabilidades de sufrir violencia sexual, digital y psicológica. El bajo rendimiento escolar se asoció con menores probabilidades de informar negligencia (RMa=0.6 IC95% [0.5–0.8]) y violencia sexual (RMa=0.5 IC95% [0.3–0.8]), mientras que estar empleado se asoció con mayores probabilidades de violencia física (RMa=1.5 IC95% [1.3–1.8]) y negligencia (RMa=1.3 IC95% [1.1–1.5]). Un mayor uso de redes sociales y videojuegos se asoció con mayores probabilidades de violencia física, psicológica y digital.
Es necesario implementar programas y políticas públicas integrales que aborden la violencia e implementar estrategias intersectoriales de intervención social en salud mental.</p>
