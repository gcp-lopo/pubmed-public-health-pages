      <div class="news-abstract">
        <p>Addressing the association between early-changing Alzheimer disease (AD) biomarkers and cognition is essential for characterizing preclinical AD. However, few studies have explored this relationship longitudinally, especially across multiple biomarker modalities. The aim of this study was to evaluate longitudinal associations of multimodal core 1 AD biomarkers with cognition in a cognitively unimpaired (CU) population at increased risk of AD dementia.
This prospective observational study included CU individuals from the Alzheimer's and Families+ cohort, based in Barcelona, Spain. Individuals had available baseline CSF biomarker measurements (normal or AD continuum profiles) and longitudinal neuropsychological assessments (2 time points, 3-year follow-up). The primary study outcome was the modified Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite (mPACC) score. Study measurements included plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 217, CSF p-tau181/β-amyloid (Aβ) 42, and Aβ PET ([¹⁸F]flutemetamol). Mixed-effects models were used to evaluate the longitudinal associations between fluid biomarkers and mPACC score; voxel-wise models were used to evaluate the longitudinal association between neuroimaging and mPACC score. Sensitivity analyses evaluated these associations stratifying by Aβ status.
In total, 350 individuals were included (mean age: 61 years; 60% female; mean education: 14 years). In the full sample, increases in plasma p-tau217 concentration (βSTD = -0.124, 95% CI -0.172 to -0.076; p < 0.001), CSF p-tau181/Aβ42 ratio (βSTD = -0.059, 95% CI -0.100 to -0.019; p = 0.005), and Aβ PET load in the prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, precuneus, and anterior temporal regions were associated with mPACC decline. In the Aβ-positive group (35%), increases in plasma p-tau217 concentration (βSTD = -0.121, 95% CI -0.194 to -0.049; p < 0.001) and Aβ PET load in anterior temporal regions were associated with mPACC decline. In the Aβ-negative group (65%), increases in plasma p-tau217 concentration (βSTD = -0.084, 95% CI -0.157 to -0.011; p = 0.024) and Aβ PET load in frontoparietal regions were associated with mPACC decline.
This study demonstrated significant longitudinal associations between multimodal core 1 AD biomarkers and cognitive function over 3 years in CU individuals, including those at the Aβ-negative stage. Distinct biomarker modalities provided complementary insights, emphasizing the potential of blood-based biomarkers for tracking subtle cognitive decline and neuroimaging for delineating vulnerable brain regions in aging and preclinical AD. These findings are crucial for identifying and monitoring high-risk CU individuals, further informing preventive intervention strategies for AD.</p>

      <div class="news-abstract">
        <p>Evaluating and managing patients with recurrent stroke presents a significant challenge, particularly in individuals with underlying autoimmune or rheumatologic conditions. We present a case of a 56-year-old woman with a long-standing history of medically controlled systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who has experienced multiple ischemic strokes and a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Despite an unremarkable standard stroke workup and adherence to secondary prevention medications, including antithrombotic and lipid-lowering therapies, the patient continued to experience recurrent strokes, warranting further investigation. Serial follow-up imaging including CT angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, and conventional angiography revealed progressive intracranial vascular narrowing, prompting a broad workup and differential diagnosis. This case highlights the importance of a stepwise and comprehensive diagnostic approach that integrates traditional vascular risk factors with those related to underlying autoimmune disease. It provides an insight into the diagnostic strategies and management of this high-risk population, ultimately supporting the need for personalized patient care to address the multifactorial causes of stroke.</p>

      <div class="news-abstract">
        <p>Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. While its impact on white matter is well documented, CSVD-related gray matter alterations are less understood. In this work, we aimed to investigate the association between CSVD burden, regional gray matter integrity, and cognitive function in a large population-based cohort.
We examined participants from the Hamburg City Health Study, who underwent multidomain neuropsychological testing and multimodal neuroimaging. A composite CSVD burden score was calculated by aggregating the white matter hyperintensity load, Fazekas score, perivascular space (PVS) count, and peak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity (PSMD). Advanced imaging techniques based on T1-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and diffusion-weighted MRI were leveraged to assess the integrity of cortical and subcortical gray matter, including the hippocampus. General cognitive ability (g) was derived by a principal component analysis of cognitive test scores.
Data from 2,603 participants (median age 65 years [interquartile range 14], 44.0% female) were analyzed. Higher CSVD burden was significantly associated with regionally specific gray matter abnormalities after family-wise error correction (family-wise error-corrected p value [pFWE] < 0.05): higher mean diffusivity and free water in cingulate, insular, and temporal cortices and basal ganglia; lower tissue fractional anisotropy in the anterior cingulate, insula, caudate, and hippocampus; lower T1/FLAIR ratio in the temporal cortex and hippocampus; lower thickness in the anterior cingulate, insula, and temporal cortex; and altered subcortical/hippocampal volumes. Aggregated indices reflecting these CSVD-related gray matter abnormalities were significantly associated with lower general cognitive ability (mean diffusivity: standardized β = 0.140, 95% CI 0.09-0.19, pFWE < 0.001; free water: standardized β = 0.183, 95% CI 0.13-0.23, pFWE < 0.001; tissue fractional anisotropy: standardized β = -0.097, 95% CI -0.13 to -0.06, pFWE < 0.001; T1/FLAIR: standardized β = -0.090, 95% CI -0.13 to -0.05, pFWE < 0.001; thickness/volume: standardized β = -0.051, 95% CI -0.09 to -0.01, pFWE = 0.026).
Complementing previous research that focuses on CSVD and white matter changes, our study highlights abnormal gray matter integrity as a possible link between small vessel pathology and cognitive disorders.</p>

        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted essential health care services globally, including routine childhood immunization programs. Ecuador faced significant challenges in maintaining vaccination coverage during this period.
The aim of this study is to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on routine childhood vaccination coverage in Ecuador by comparing prepandemic (2019) and pandemic (2020-2021) data.
This retrospective observational study analyzed vaccination coverage data from the Ministry of Public Health of Ecuador and demographic data from the National Institute of Statistics and Censuses. We examined routine childhood vaccination coverage for children under 24 months across all 24 provinces. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (version 28.0), including descriptive statistics and comparative analysis. Coverage rates were calculated as percentages of children in target age groups receiving recommended doses.
A significant decline in routine childhood vaccination coverage was observed during the pandemic. BCG vaccine coverage decreased from 86.4% in 2019 (n=286,569) to 80.7% in 2020 (n=266,961) and 75.3% in 2021 (n=248,812). Pentavalent vaccine third dose coverage dropped from 85.0% to 68.0% across the same period. The most dramatic decline was seen in measles-mumps-rubella vaccine second dose coverage, falling from 75.7% in 2019 to 58.4% in 2021. Coastal and highland provinces experienced the most severe reductions, with approximately 137,000 fewer doses administered in 2020 compared to stable prepandemic levels.
The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted routine childhood vaccination coverage in Ecuador, with sustained declines through 2021. Regional disparities were evident, with vulnerable populations facing greater challenges accessing immunization services. Urgent interventions, including catch-up campaigns and strengthened health systems, are needed to restore coverage levels and prevent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.</p>

      <div class="news-abstract">
        <p>Mpox (monkeypox) outbreaks since 2022 have emphasized the importance of accessible health education materials. However, many Japanese online resources on mpox are difficult to understand, creating barriers for public health communication. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) such as ChatGPT-4o show promise in generating more comprehensible and actionable health education content.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the comprehensibility, actionability, and readability of Japanese health education materials on mpox compared with texts generated by ChatGPT-4o.
A cross-sectional study was conducted using systematic quantitative content analysis. A total of 119 publicly available Japanese health education materials on mpox were compared with 30 texts generated by ChatGPT-4o. Websites containing videos, social media posts, academic papers, and non-Japanese language content were excluded. For generating ChatGPT-4o texts, we used 3 separate prompts with 3 different keywords. For each keyword, text generation was repeated 10 times, with prompt history deleted each time to prevent previous outputs from influencing subsequent generations and to account for output variability. The Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for Printable Materials (PEMAT-P) was used to assess the understandability and actionability of the generated text, while the Japanese Readability Measurement System (jReadability) was used to evaluate readability. The Journal of the American Medical Association benchmark criteria were applied to evaluate the quality of the materials.
A total of 119 Japanese mpox-related health education web pages and 30 ChatGPT-4o-generated texts were analyzed. AI-generated texts significantly outperformed web pages in understandability, with 80% (24/30) scoring ≥70% in PEMAT-P (P<.001). Readability scores for AI texts (mean 2.9, SD 0.4) were also higher than those for web pages (mean 2.4, SD 1.0; P=.009). However, web pages included more visual aids and actionable guidance such as practical instructions, which were largely absent in AI-generated content. Government agencies authored 90 (75.6%) out of 119 web pages, but only 31 (26.1%) included proper attribution. Most web pages (117/119, 98.3%) disclosed sponsorship and ownership.
AI-generated texts were easier to understand and read than traditional web-based materials. However, web-based texts provided more visual aids and practical guidance. Combining AI-generated texts with traditional web-based materials may enhance the effectiveness of health education materials and improve accessibility to a broader audience. Further research is needed to explore the integration of AI-generated content into public health communication strategies and policies to optimize information delivery during health crises such as the mpox outbreak.</p>

      <div class="news-abstract">
        <p>Masquerade syndromes encompass a heterogeneous group of ocular conditions that mimic intraocular inflammation but are caused by non-inflammatory processes. Accurate distinction from true uveitis is critical, as misdiagnosis can lead to inappropriate immunosuppression, delayed definitive therapy, and irreversible visual loss. This review focuses on non-neoplastic disorders presenting as posterior segment inflammation, highlighting their epidemiology, clinical hallmarks, multimodal imaging features, and diagnostic pitfalls. We discuss inherited retinal degenerations such as retinitis pigmentosa, chronic endophthalmitis, retinal detachment syndromes, intraocular foreign bodies, idiopathic uveal effusion, central serous chorioretinopathy, amyloidosis, and vascular anomalies including Coats disease. Developmental anomalies like persistent fetal vasculature and rare entities such as X-linked retinoschisis are also examined. For each disorder, we outline distinguishing characteristics from uveitis and propose a systematic diagnostic approach integrating history, examination, targeted laboratory testing, and imaging modalities including OCT, FAF, FA, ICGA, and ultrasonography. Early recognition of these mimickers is essential to guide appropriate management, prevent unnecessary exposure to corticosteroids or immunomodulators, and optimize visual prognosis.</p>

        <p>Converging etiological evidence supports a genetic risk for developmental stuttering; however, major gaps detailing the genetic architecture remain. Technological advances in genetics have allowed us to explore novel approaches to analyzing this complex trait, but conducting robust and replicable genetic studies requires large, well-phenotyped cohorts of subjects. This article reviews previous research strategies employed to overcome these challenges in identifying genetic variants associated with stuttering and translating stuttering-associated variants into molecular and cellular mechanisms.
We present an overview of data sources and strategies research teams have utilized for the genetic study of stuttering, highlighting the advantages and limitations of each approach. Primary data sources include (a) the International Stuttering Project, (b) the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, (c) BioVU, and (d) 23andMe, Inc. In addition to genome-wide association studies (GWASs), we review multiple post-GWAS follow-up analyses to probe the functional impact of stuttering-associated genetic variants and offer new transcriptome-wide analyses.
To date, a diverse array of approaches has resulted in the identification of over 50 stuttering-associated genes. Many genetic associations were near or within genes previously linked to known neurological traits, highlighting a neurological role in stuttering. Additionally, validation studies using polygenic risk scores suggested a high level of genetic concordance between our samples. Functional follow-up studies suggest stuttering-associated variants may affect gene expression in tissues relevant to speech-related structures and neural correlates.
While understanding how specific regions of the genome contribute to stuttering risk remains complex, research from our team and others has utilized a variety of data sources in an attempt to overcome previous limitations in the identification of genetic variation associated with stuttering. As the field of genetics evolves toward large-scale biobanks for research and discovery, prioritizing inclusion of traits such as stuttering will be key.

      <div class="news-abstract">
        <p>Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a critical public health concern among university students, often considered a gateway behavior to suicide. With the widespread use of mobile phones, understanding the association between specific mobile phone use behaviors (eg, presleep and postwake mobile phone use) and NSSI has become increasingly important for targeted prevention.
This study aimed to explore the association between presleep and postwake mobile phone use and NSSI among Chinese university students, examining potential dose-response relationships and sex differences.
A multistage random cluster sampling survey was conducted across 6 universities in Shaanxi province (northwest China) from October 2022 to November 2022. A total of 18,585 undergraduates were included in the final analysis. Binary logistic regression models were used to examine the association between presleep and postwake mobile phone use duration and past-month NSSI, whereas restricted cubic spline regression was applied to assess dose-response relationships.
The prevalence of past-month NSSI among participants was 3.81% (709/18,585). Compared with individuals who reported lower presleep mobile phone use (0-30 minutes per day), those with higher presleep mobile phone use had substantially increased odds of NSSI, with odds ratios of 1.34 (95% CI 1.07-1.66) for the group with 61 to 120 minutes per day of use and 1.93 (95% CI 1.53-2.42) for the group with ≥120 minutes per day of use. For postwake mobile phone use, compared with the group with 0 to 1 minute per day of use, the participants in the group with >30 minutes per day of use showed a significant association with NSSI (odds ratio 1.27, 95% CI 1.02-1.58) in the fully adjusted model. Continuous variable analyses revealed that each 10-minute increase in presleep and postwake use was associated with a 3% and 2% higher NSSI risk, respectively. Restricted cubic spline analysis confirmed linear dose-response relationships for both presleep and postwake use (P>.05 for nonlinearity). No significant sex differences were observed in these associations.
Prolonged presleep and postwake mobile phone use exhibited linear associations with NSSI among Chinese university students, with no significant sex disparities. These findings underscore the necessity of longitudinal studies to establish causality, elucidate underlying mechanisms, and inform targeted interventions.</p>

      <div class="news-abstract">
        <p>During the COVID-19 outbreak in May 2021, our hospital-designated as a specialized facility for severely infected patients-faced critical staff and resource shortages. The urgent need for efficient bed management to ensure timely admissions underscored the inefficiencies of the manual, phone-based allocation process, which averaged 454 seconds per query. Traditional IT solutions were not feasible due to time and cost constraints.
This study aims to design and implement a rapid, zero-cost Quick Isolation Bed Inquiry System that provides real-time bed information and enables timely admissions without requiring additional workforce or expense.
We conducted a 3-cycle pre-post quality improvement study guided by the Toyota business practice (TBP), an 8-step problem-solving framework. After clarifying the problem and constructing a value stream map, we identified bottlenecks. A user-centered solution was developed by leveraging an underutilized data export function in the hospital's bed inquiry platform. Using Microsoft Excel Visual Basic for Applications, we automated the filtering and display of relevant bed information. The primary outcomes were process time and number of steps; secondary outcomes included staff time savings and system accuracy.
The baseline manual process required 25 steps and 454 seconds to complete a query. The new system reduced this to 3 steps and 12 seconds, representing a 97.4% gain in efficiency. Single-click execution generated 3 outputs (administrative PDF, large-screen display, and mobile version) in 4 seconds, with distribution to the hospital LINE group completed in 7 seconds. Reliability reached 100%, with continuous availability through virtual private network access. Development and debugging were completed within 3 days using only existing resources. Postpandemic, the system was adapted for general ward management with minimal modifications.
Applying TBP enabled the rapid development of a user-centered, zero-cost bed management tool by repurposing existing digital assets. The intervention markedly improved efficiency, reliability, and usability without additional staffing or expenditure, providing a scalable model for agile health care systems operating under resource constraints. Future work will focus on deeper automation, such as application programming interface-based real-time updates, and on evaluating downstream impacts on patient flow and bed turnover.</p>

      <div class="news-abstract">
        <p>With the growing popularity and convenience of the internet, an increasing number of men who have sex with men (MSM) are seeking casual sexual partners online. However, the effect of online casual sexual behavior on other HIV-related risk behaviors remains unclear.
This study aims to explore the characteristics of internet-based casual sexual behavior and its relationship with HIV-related risk behaviors among MSM.
This cross-sectional study was conducted between June and December 2018 in 4 cities in Zhejiang Province, China. Peer-driven sampling was used for recruitment. Announcements were disseminated by 4 community-based organizations and 10 voluntary counseling and testing clinics online and offline. After informed consent, participants completed an electronic questionnaire covering demographic characteristics, casual sexual behaviors, HIV-related risk behaviors, and HIV prevention. SPSS (version 19.0; IBM Corp) was used to conduct chi-square tests, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses using a backward stepwise method based on the likelihood ratio test, and Poisson regression with robust variance to identify associations between finding casual sexual partners online and other risk behaviors. P values of <.05 were considered statistically significant.
In the past 6 months, 40.2% (302/751) of participants reported finding casual sexual partners online; 18.9% (142/751) reported finding casual sexual partners offline; 7.6% (57/751) reported having sexual intercourse with MSM without condoms after drinking alcohol; and 6.9% (52/751) reported condomless sex after using stimulants. Among those who found partners online, 62.5% (188/301) did so more than once per month and 39.5% (113/286) had more than one online sexual partner. In total, 39.3% (114/290) had sex with online partners at home and 10.1% (30/297) sought partners in other cities. Compared with participants who engaged in receptive anal intercourse (or both roles), those who engaged only in insertive intercourse reported a higher proportion of finding partners online more than once per month (72.7% vs 57.4%, P=.01), having more than 2 online sexual partners (52.1% vs 33.3%, P=.002), and conducting inconsistent condom use with online sexual partners (40.0% vs 25.8%, P=.01). Regression analysis showed that, compared with MSM who did not find partners online, those who did were more likely to report finding casual sexual partners offline (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 9.398; 95% CI 5.956-14.829), having sex without condoms after drinking alcohol (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] 1.788; 95% CI 1.062-3.011), and having sexual intercourse without condoms after using stimulants (aPR 2.064; 95% CI 1.178-3.617).
Internet-based casual sexual behavior is increasingly common among MSM. Finding partners online was associated with offline partner-seeking and condomless use after alcohol or stimulant use. Future HIV prevention efforts should emphasize behavioral interventions tailored to MSM who use dating apps.</p>

      <div class="news-abstract">
        <p>Asian American patients have reported unique needs and barriers related to cancer care. While patient navigation can facilitate care coordination and help address barriers to care, in-person navigation is time and resource intensive. Virtual patient navigation can extend the benefits of patient navigation to more patients, especially those with non-English language needs.
This study aimed to develop, implement, and test an online portal providing virtual navigation, including access to resources in English, Chinese, and Vietnamese, for Asian American patients with newly diagnosed colorectal, lung, or liver cancer.
The online portal was built on a secure, cloud-based platform. We recruited adults aged 21 years or older with a recent diagnosis of stage I-IV colorectal, lung, or liver cancer; who identified as Asian American; spoke English, Cantonese, Mandarin, or Vietnamese; and resided in the Greater San Francisco Bay Area, California. Participants were assigned a language-concordant navigator who assessed their needs and provided tailored resources and support over 6 months through the online portal. Participants completed baseline, 3-month, 6-month, and user experience surveys. We report descriptive statistics on sociodemographic characteristics, quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General [FACT-G]), and user experiences. We used generalized estimating equations (GEE) to analyze repeated measures of quality of life.
The online portal included (1) a public-facing landing page, (2) a navigator interface, and (3) a participant interface, which were all available in English, Chinese, and Vietnamese. Among 51 participants, 47 (92%) and 49 (96%) completed the 3- and 6-month surveys, respectively. The mean age was 58 (SD 13) years, with 37 (73%) men, 33 (65%) speaking English, and 20 (39%) having less than a college education. Twenty-six participants (51%) had colorectal cancer, 21 (41%) had lung cancer, and 4 (8%) had liver cancer. The average total FACT-G score was 73.0 (SD 17) at baseline, 73.2 (SD 17) at 3 months, and 75.1 (SD 19) at 6 months. In GEE models, participants reported an increase in emotional well-being at 6 months compared to baseline (coefficient 0.99, 95% CI 0.01-1.97). Among the 47 participants who completed the user experience survey, some reported issues with registering and logging into the portal, but 44 (94%) reported that the program was culturally appropriate, 35 (74%) found calls from the navigators helpful, and 35 (74%) would recommend the program to others.
This multilingual virtual patient navigation program for Asian American patients with cancer was deemed culturally appropriate and helpful in our pilot study. Emotional well-being improved among users of the portal. Some participants reported technical challenges, but most were satisfied with the program. Language-concordant virtual patient navigation and online supportive care tools can extend the reach and benefits of patient navigation.</p>

        <p>Traumatic stress symptoms increase the risk for mental health problems. We examine patterns of COVID-19-related changes in youth and family experiences (material hardships, behavior change, coping strategies), how these patterns vary with sociodemographic factors, and how COVID-19-related experiences associate with youth pandemic-related traumatic stress (PTS) symptoms.
K-means clustering examined patterns of pandemic-related experiences in Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes data (April 2020-August 2021; N = 9,139; 48% female), a demographically and regionally diverse sample. Clusters were characterized by sociodemographic factors measured pre-pandemic. Sparse partial least squares regression evaluated associations between cluster parameters and youth PTS symptoms in two samples (children [<13 years-old, n = 1,293]; adolescents [≥13 years-old], n = 1,272).
Clustering replicated in the child and adolescent samples. One cluster reported more (HiChange) and one reported less (LoChange) pandemic-related change. The LoChange (versus HiChange) group included more Black individuals, single-parent households, and had lower income and education. PTS Scale scores were more associated with the youth's own versus the parent/caregiver's experiences. Nonetheless, across all youth, a report of "no change" in parent/caregiver behavior was associated with lower youth PTS Scale scores. For all children, lower PTS Scale scores are associated with the parent/caregiver being able to isolate. Use of coping strategies was not associated with lowered scores. Higher scores are associated with changes in youth health behaviors (e.g. eating, exercise, time outside), health care access, and increased media use.
Results provide information for public health guidance, which can minimize youth PTS symptoms now and in future health disasters: stability in health behaviors, access to healthcare, and ability to isolate are paramount.</p>

        <p>Little is known about whether Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act affects insurance coverage among adult survivors of childhood cancer, a high-risk population requiring lifetime follow-up care. We examined the association of Medicaid expansion with Medicaid enrollment among participants in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.
We identified 13,355 adult survivors (age 18-64 years) diagnosed with cancer at age <21 years between 1970 and 1999 and linked these survivors to Medicaid administrative data from 2010 to 2019. Outcomes included the percentage of survivors with any Medicaid enrollment and Medicaid-covered days (total number of days when a survivor was enrolled in Medicaid) each year. Multivariable difference-in-differences (DD) models were used to examine outcome changes (post- v pre-expansion) in expansion versus nonexpansion states.
Medicaid enrollment rates among survivors increased in expansion states (17.1% pre-expansion to 22.8% postexpansion) but decreased in nonexpansion states (16.6%-15.7%), leading to a net increase of 7.1 percentage points (ppts; 95% CI, 6.1 to 8.1). The DD model also showed a net mean increase of 18.7 days/year (95% CI, 15.0 to 22.4) in Medicaid-covered days in expansion relative to nonexpansion states. The expansion-associated increase in enrollment was greatest among survivors who were age 18-29 years (11.2 ppts; 95% CI, 8.3 to 14.1), non-Hispanic Black (13.6 ppts, 95% CI, 8.8 to 18.4) or Hispanic (13.4 ppts, 95% CI, 7.0 to 19.8), with <$20K in US dollars (USD) self-reported household income (13.5 ppts, 95% CI, 10.7 to 16.3), and noncollege graduates (9.3 ppts, 95% CI, 7.7 to 10.9). Similar patterns were observed when examining Medicaid-covered days.
To our knowledge, we provide the first evidence of increased Medicaid enrollment and longer coverage duration among adult survivors of childhood cancer after Medicaid expansion. Greater increases were seen among survivors from underrepresented racial/ethnic backgrounds, young adult survivors, and those with lower socioeconomic status, providing a mechanism to reduce disparities and ensure long-term medical care for childhood cancer survivors.</p>

        <p>Patient messaging technologies offer treatment information and recommendations through web-based platforms, patient portals, mobile apps, and SMS text messaging. Many of these technologies have started to incorporate messages that are crafted by artificial intelligence (AI). Such tools are most effective when constructed with theoretical grounding and iterative input from end users. Thus, we outline a human-centered design approach for developing patient messaging content that aligns with self-determination theory (SDT), a widely used framework that has shown positive impacts on health behavior change. We illustrate our approach step-by-step for the development of messages that promote evidence-based treatment opportunities for patients with chronic pain. Messages were initially developed by subject matter experts and refined using SDT constructs (autonomy, competence, and relatedness) and motivation and behavior change techniques. Using a rapid prototyping approach, we sequentially met with 3 patient engagement boards to elicit feedback on message prototypes and enhance their content. We synthesized and aligned disparate feedback across boards with SDT and motivation and behavior change techniques. Drawing upon the input from the engagement boards, existing co-design approaches, and the field of human-centered AI, we recommend strategies to collaborate with patient partners to enhance the readability and clarity of messaging content. Recommended strategies include (1) involve engagement boards early in messaging framing and modality selection, (2) represent diverse perspectives when refining messages, (3) acknowledge and set expectations to integrate unique experiences and views, (4) prioritize message tailoring for the population of interest, (5) incorporate continual feedback mechanisms, and (6) keep the human interaction in patient-facing messages. By illuminating the process of developing message content that aligns with SDT constructs and providing guidance for iterative patient engagement and practical prototyping, we hope this tutorial can be used to enhance patient messaging content and improve uptake of evidence-based treatments. Our approach and recommendations can also guide multidisciplinary research and design teams to build patient-centered health messages. This tutorial has special consideration for future AI-guided messaging interventions, as patients are typically not involved in message content development or framing, but early engagement can potentially mitigate known AI concerns related to privacy, transparency, and fairness. As technologies and patient populations change over time, linking continual end user input with theoretical grounding plays a key role in simplifying complex medical information and promoting understanding of treatment opportunities that can ultimately improve health outcomes.</p>

      <div class="news-abstract">
        <p>Black individuals are more likely to die from colorectal cancer (CRC) and experience more treatment-related side effects compared to White individuals. Physical activity (PA) has been associated with decreased side effects, improved CRC treatment completion rates and responses, and survival. However, Black survivors of CRC are 60% less likely to engage in PA than White survivors. The Physical Activity Centers Empowerment (PACE) study is testing an intervention specifically designed to increase PA among Black individuals diagnosed with CRC.
This study outlines the protocol for a randomized controlled trial. The study aims to test the feasibility of PACE and will use the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance (RE-AIM) framework.
The PACE study was developed in partnership with a community advisory board consisting of Black cancer advocates and survivors of cancer. The study aims to recruit 72 participants aged >18 years from North Carolina who have been diagnosed with CRC. These participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to an intervention or control group. During the 12-week intervention, all participants will receive a wearable activity tracker and informational materials from the American College of Sports Medicine's "Moving through Cancer" program. The intervention group will also receive additional PACE theory-guided intervention components, including personalized daily adaptive step goals, access to the PACE video library, and optional video chat meetings for PA support. Data will be collected at 3 time points: baseline, after the intervention (3 months), and 6 months after the intervention (9 months). Using the RE-AIM framework, the study aims to evaluate the intervention's reach, effectiveness, acceptability, implementation, and maintenance.
The National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities funded this study in 2021. Study enrollment began in August 2024 and is anticipated to conclude in December 2024.
This study will advance our understanding of effective behavioral strategies to increase PA and help advance the use of PA as a form of complementary cancer treatment, with the aim of improving health outcomes for Black survivors of CRC.

      <div class="news-abstract">
        <p>Caregivers of persons living with dementia experience significant losses as they witness the progressive cognitive decline and personality changes of their loved ones while managing substantial caregiving responsibilities. This results in pre-death grief, which is a multifaceted response to the losses experienced. Although pre-death grief is traditionally conceptualized as an intrapersonal and dyadic phenomenon, this study examines how social environments shape caregivers' grief experiences. Through semi-structured interviews with 33 dementia caregivers in Singapore, we identified 11 distinct domains that influence grief experiences: self, persons with dementia, family, domestic workers, friends, workplaces, fellow caregivers, health and social care services, public, policy, and social-cultural contexts. Our findings reveal that pre-death grief emerges through multifaceted interactions across these domains rather than solely through individual psychological processes. Caregivers navigate personal sacrifices and other losses while experiencing validation and invalidation of the losses across different social contexts. Particularly notable is the previously unexplored role of domestic workers, who significantly influence the caregivers' grief experiences by redistributing the caregiving burden and providing emotional sustenance. The findings supplement dominant theoretical frameworks that primarily focus on intrapersonal or dyadic processes, suggesting instead that pre-death grief in dementia caregiving is fundamentally a social process. This perspective has significant implications for developing more comprehensive support systems that address the socially embedded nature of grief rather than focusing exclusively on individual coping strategies. By understanding pre-death grief as socially situated, we can better support caregivers throughout their dementia caregiving journey.</p>

      <div class="news-abstract">
        <p>Alzheimer's disease encompasses multiple biological scales, spanning molecular factors, cells, tissues, and behavioral manifestations. The interplay among these scales in shaping the clinical phenotype is not yet fully comprehended. In particular, there is great interest in understanding the heterogeneity of the clinical aspects of AD in order to improve treatment and prevention, by targeting those aspects most susceptible to the disease. Here we employed a systems biology approach to address this issue, utilizing multilayer network analysis and deep phenotyping. This integrative analysis incorporated genomics, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, tau and amyloid beta (Aβ) PET imaging, brain MRI data, risk factors, and clinical information (cognitive tests scores, Clinical Dementia Rating and clinical diagnosis) obtained through the ADNI collaboration. Multilayer networks were built based on mutual information between the elements of each layer and between layers. Boolean simulations allowed us to identify paths that transmit dynamic information across layers. The most prominent path for predicting variables in the cognitive phenotype layer included the PET radiotracer fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in the posterior cingulate. Combinations of different symptomatic variables, mainly related to mental health (depression, mood swings, drowsiness) and vascular features (hypertension, cardiovascular history), were also part of the paths explaining the average phenotype. Our results show that integrating the flow of information across biological scales reveals relevant paths for AD, which can be subsequently explored as potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets. In particular, our results point for paths related with brain hypometabolism as a key feature in AD.</p>

        <p>BackgroundPhysical activity is essential for preventing chronic disease and maintaining overall health. However, hospital nurses may face challenges maintaining adequate physical activity due to demanding work schedules and occupational stressors.ObjectiveTo examine the levels of physical activity among hospital nurses in Jordan and to identify demographic, occupational, and health-related factors associated with physical activity.MethodA cross-sectional survey was conducted among 750 nurses across Jordanian hospitals, with 597 respondents (80% response rate). Validated self-administered questionnaires were used to assess demographic, work characteristics, psychological well-being, sleep quality, musculoskeletal pain, and physical activity. Descriptive statistics summarized participant characteristics, and multiple linear regression was performed to identify independent associations with physical activity levels.ResultsThe mean age of participants was 32.1 years, and average work hours were 43.4 h per week. Approximately 31% of nurses report moderate physical activity levels, while 40% reported high physical activity levels. Higher physical activity levels were independently associated with longer work hours (β = 46.1; 95% CI: 1.9 to 90.2), more frequent night shifts (β = 163.8; 95% CI: 11.8 to 315.7), and more musculoskeletal pain sites (β = 254.9; 95% CI: 171.3 to 338.7). Having a chronic disease was significantly associated with lower physical activity (β = -1384.1; 95% CI: -2443.5 to -324.1).ConclusionMost nurses met recommended physical activity levels, and their engagement in physical activity was influenced by work demands and health status. Workplace health promotion initiatives should consider these factors to effectively support and sustain physical activity among hospital nurses.</p>

      <div class="news-abstract">
        <p>Heterosexually identifying migrants in Australia are among populations experiencing increasing HIV notifications, highlighting concerns about low rates of sexual health testing and awareness of Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP). Utilising in-depth interviews, we explored perceptions of HIV risk among 16 heterosexually identifying migrants from Southeast Asia, Northeast Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. Domains of inquiry were HIV risk assessment and management, knowledge and attitudes. Participants were majority female, aged 35 years and above, living in Australia for at least three years. Constructed themes were stigma and personal responsibility, access and awareness, proximity and distance, and differing socio-cultural attitudes. Cultural or community-based stigma influenced participants' perceptions of HIV or their reluctance to use PrEP, linked to morality and safety concerns. Limited uptake of PrEP was contrasted by generally high knowledge of HIV transmission, prevention, and treatment. Attitudes and perceptions were commonly influenced by access to sexual health education, exposure to and visibility of HIV information, social proximity to people living with HIV, and sociocultural norms. Participant insights highlight the need for culturally responsive public health education outside dedicated sexual health spaces, particularly regarding PrEP, and reinforce the need for targeted, peer and community-led health promotion responses to support virtual elimination of HIV.</p>

      <div class="news-abstract">
        <p>The Buccal Micronucleus Cytome (B-MNcyt) assay is used world-wide to study chromosomal abnormalities and environmental genotoxicity and cytotoxicity in humans. The aim of this paper is to discuss the strengths and limitations of the B-MNcyt assay and to identify emerging opportunities to further improve and validate its use. This can be achieved by innovating and evolving the B-MNcyt assay by identifying and solving important knowledge and technological gaps that hinder its utility. The cells examined in the B-MNcyt assay are squamous epithelial cells that can be easily collected from the inside of the mouth. These cells are post-mitotic cells generated from the proliferative basal layer and may contain micronuclei (MN). MN can be generated during mitosis of the basal cells prior to their differentiation into squamous cells. The B-MNcyt assay is increasingly being used to measure DNA damage induced in vivo by environmental genotoxins. Results with this assay have been shown to correlate positively with MN frequency measured using the well-validated lymphocyte cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome (L-CBMNcyt) assay. However, the B-MNcyt assay has some important limitations that need to be addressed to achieve a similar level of validation and applicability as the L-CBMNcyt assay. These include: (i) lack of evidence that the buccal MN frequency predicts disease risk in prospective studies; (ii) no automated scoring system to score MN in buccal cells which is essential to achieve statistically robust results and to improve the feasibility of the assay in population studies; (iii) kinetics of MN expression in buccal cells needs more research to define optimal time frames to score MN after acute exposure or during chronic genotoxin exposure; (iv) studies are also required to test the suitability of using the B-MNcyt assay for radiation exposure bio-dosimetry. This paper discusses these issues and provides some suggestions how to address them.</p>

        <p>BackgroundWith the acceleration of coal mine intelligence transformation, new generation miners (NGM) are gradually becoming the main force of production. The correlation between their work alienation (WA) and unsafe behavior (UB) has become a core challenge of safety management.ObjectiveThis study aims to explore the influence mechanism of WA on NGM' UB and test the mediating function of organizational identification (OI) and work engagement (WE) as well as the moderating effect of psychological capital (PC).MethodsThis study takes 355 NGM from Shanxi Datuhe Coking Co., Ltd in China as a sample, adopts the structural equation model and Bootstrap method to conduct data analysis, and examines the relationship between variables and their function mechanism.ResultsWA is significantly positively correlated with UB; OI and WE independently mediate this relationship, with empirical evidence of chain mediation under generational characteristics in high-risk industrial settings. PC significantly moderates the negative impact of WA on OI and WE, and individuals with high PC can effectively buffer the negative impact of alienation.ConclusionsThe study innovatively integrates PC theory with JD-R model, revealing WA affects NGM' UB through OI and WE sequentially. PC buffers WA's negative influence on these mediators particularly in high-risk industries. Strengthening OI, enhancing WE, and cultivating miners' PC can mitigate alienation's adverse outcomes, providing strategic insights for coal mine safety management.</p>

      <div class="news-abstract">
        <p>Pediatric sarcopenia is an emerging health issue that affects muscle development, strength, and overall well-being in children and adolescents. While it was initially linked to aging, recent studies highlight its presence in younger populations, particularly among those with chronic conditions. This condition affects growth and neurodevelopment in the short term and is associated with an increased risk of long-term complications, namely metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Several factors contribute to pediatric sarcopenia, including inadequate prenatal nutrition, low birth weight, genetic susceptibility, insufficient dietary protein intake, sedentary behaviors, obesity, metabolic imbalances, and chronic illnesses. Reduced muscle mass impairs bone health, delays growth spurts, and affects physical performance, which may result in a lower quality of life. In children with chronic diseases, sarcopenia exacerbates clinical outcomes, prolongs hospital stays, and increases the likelihood of complications. Diagnosing sarcopenia in children is complex due to differing growth patterns. Existing assessment methods, such as imaging techniques and body composition analysis, lack standardized reference values tailored to pediatric populations, which makes early detection challenging. Preventive strategies emphasize physical activity, especially resistance exercises (muscle strengthening), reduced screen time, improved dietary habits, and sleep hygiene. Innovative treatments are being explored, including targeted drug delivery to the muscle to minimize side effects, regenerative approaches utilizing nanoparticles, and myostatin inhibitors for stimulating muscle growth. Stem cell therapy and biomaterial-based muscle reconstruction are also under investigation; however, pediatric-specific therapeutic guidelines remain undefined. Early intervention is crucial for reducing its negative effects and fostering healthier developmental paths.</p>

      <div class="news-abstract">
        <p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-catalytic therapies have gained increasing popularity in preventing tumor metastasis and recurrence, yet their efficiency is often compromised by limited systemic immune activation. Herein, we report the de novo design of Ru-coordinated bis-Schiff base salphen-covalent organic frameworks (SCOF-Ru) to serve as semiconducting artificial enzymes with radio-activable ROS-catalytic efficiency and antitumor immunity for suppressing tumor metastasis and recurrence. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the semiconducting SCOF-Ru displays large π-conjugation, efficient electron transfer, strong electron-hole separation, and unique Ru2-N4O2 catalytic centers, enabling the most superior ROS production capability under low-dose X-ray irradiation. Rather than relying on high-Z elements, semiconducting SCOF-Ru with optimized band structures endows Ru sites with high radiosensitization effects. Our findings have disclosed that the SCOF-Ru can not only effectively inhibit DNA repair but also trigger robust apoptosis through the downregulation of calcium signaling pathways. Correspondingly, the therapeutic superiority and recurrence inhibition efficacies of SCOF-Ru have been validated in different tumor models, especially radiotherapy-resistant patient-derived xenograft models. Combined with immune checkpoint blockade, radio-activable SCOF-Ru shows great potential to robustly inhibit the growth of distant tumors. We believe the innovative design of ROS-catalytic and radio-activable artificial enzymes will enable a promising avenue for treating malignant tumors.</p>

        <p>Germline-targeting is a promising approach to HIV vaccine development that begins with the elicitation of precursors to broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), but it remains unclear whether simultaneous elicitation of precursors to multiple epitopes on the HIV envelope (Env) would be inhibited by competition. This study used preclinical mouse models with physiologically relevant frequencies of bnAb precursor-bearing B cells to compare precursor elicitation by coadministration of multiple protein or mRNA lipid nanoparticle (mRNA-LNP) germline-targeting immunogens. These immunogens activate multiple bnAb precursor classes targeting distinct epitopes on Env but with evidence of potential competition. Simultaneous delivery of immunogens encoded by mRNA-LNPs, however, drove maturation across different precursor frequencies and immunogen doses. Furthermore, administration of a cocktail of mRNA-LNP immunogens (N332-GT5 gp151, ApexGT5 gp151, eOD-GT8 60mer, and 10E8-GT12 24mer) led to balanced activation of four distinct bnAb precursor classes, indicating that multiepitope HIV bnAb precursor priming might be successfully implemented in humans but might be immunogen dependent.</p>

        <p>Reactions with dissolved organic matter (DOM) govern the sinks and concentrations of halogen radicals in aquatic environments, yet the impact of seasonal and regional temperature variations remains unclear. Here, second-order rate constants (k) for four halogen radicals (Cl•, Br•, Cl2•-, and Br2•-) reacting with six DOM isolates were determined from 9 to 39 °C. At 25 °C, k values (MC-1 s-1) were approximately 105-106 for Br2•-, 106-107 for Cl2•-, and 108 for Cl•/Br•. Their temperature dependence followed the Arrhenius equation, yielding apparent activation energies (Ea) of 5.8-34.1 kJ mol-1. DOM reactions with Cl• and Br• were nearly barrierless, with average Ea of 9.7 (Cl•) and 13.2 kJ mol-1 (Br•), while Cl2•- and Br2•- displayed stronger temperature dependence, with average Ea of >20 kJ mol-1. Empirical models were developed to predict both Ea and the pre-exponential factor (A) from bulk DOM properties. Thermodynamic analysis reveals entropy-driven control of Cl•/Br• reactions with DOM, whereas both enthalpy and entropy shaped Cl2•-/Br2•- reactivity. Incorporating temperature dependence into kinetic modeling quantitatively explained the micropollutant degradation during advanced oxidation. This study establishes a quantitative framework linking water temperature and DOM properties with halogen radical fate in aquatic systems.</p>
