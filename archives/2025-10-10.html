<h2 id="article-1">1. Core Clinical Features Associated With Survival in Patients With Dementia With Lewy Bodies.</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: Neurology
<strong>发表日期</strong>: 2025-Nov-11
<strong>链接</strong>: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41066723">PubMed</a></p>

<h3 id="摘要">摘要</h3>
<p>This analysis used clinical data from prospectively followed participants meeting criteria for probable dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) in the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) between 1998 and 2024. DLB is characterized by unique core features of visual hallucinations (VHs), parkinsonism, REM sleep behavior disorder, and cognitive fluctuations with a variable disease course. DLB is associated with a poor prognosis, but whether these unique DLB core clinical features influence survival is unknown. We aimed to determine whether core clinical features are associated with survival in patients with probable DLB.
Patients followed in the Mayo Clinic ADRC between 1998 and 2024 underwent annual clinical assessments. Those who met clinical criteria for probable DLB were analyzed. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazard models using age as the time scale determined associations between the individual and cumulative number of core clinical DLB features and survival. The prognostic significance of core features present at the time DLB criteria were met was assessed in separate models. Models were adjusted for sex and duration from the onset of cognitive symptoms to DLB diagnosis.
Of 488 patients with probable DLB meeting inclusion criteria, 118 (24%) were women with a mean age of 71.9 ± 8.4 years at the time of meeting probable DLB criteria. Shorter survival was associated with the development of VHs (hazard ratio [HR] 3.25, 95% CI 2.46-4.29) and parkinsonism (HR 2.28, 95% CI 1.54-3.39) during the disease course and VHs at the time of DLB diagnosis (HR 1.60, 95% CI 1.18-2.16). All four core features were also associated with shorter survival (4 core features vs 2 core features, HR 3.58 95% CI 2.66-4.80, 4 core features vs 3 core features, HR 2.46, 95% CI 1.86-3.25). In 191 patients (45 women (24%) with a mean age of 71.2 ± 8.6 years at probable DLB diagnosis) with autopsy-confirmed DLB, VHs, parkinsonism, and all four core features were associated with shorter survival. Sex was not associated with survival.
VHs, parkinsonism, and the development of all 4 core features were associated with shorter survival in probable and in autopsy-confirmed DLB. These findings have important prognostic and management implications for patients with DLB and their caregivers.</p>

<h2 id="article-2">2. Work satisfaction, stress and burnout in New Zealand ophthalmologists: a comparison of public hospital and private practice.</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: The New Zealand medical journal

<h3 id="摘要-1">摘要</h3>
<p>In New Zealand, ophthalmologists encounter varying degrees of work stress, job satisfaction and burnout. Significant clinical demands, long work hours and high-pressure responsibilities increase the likelihood of burnout in this specialty. The present study aims to examine differences in ophthalmologists’ work stress, job satisfaction and burnout across public hospital and private practice settings.
A cross-sectional quantitative study was conducted using a modified Mini Z 2.0 Burnout Survey to assess workplace satisfaction, stress and burnout among 171 New Zealand ophthalmologists. Demographic and practice-related data were also collected.
Out of 161 delivered surveys, 84 responses were received (52% response rate). Among respondents, 84.5% had public sector roles and 81% worked in the private sector. Twenty-one percent of public sector ophthalmologists reported a joyous workplace (Mini Z score ≥30) compared with 75% in the private sector. Public sector clinicians reported significantly higher burnout symptoms, stress levels and workplace disorder, as well as poorer workload control and misalignment with leadership, compared with their private sector counterparts.
The study highlights substantial disparities in job satisfaction and burnout between ophthalmologists working in the public and private sector. Factors such as excessive workload, bureaucratic inefficiencies and limited resource allocation in the public sector contribute to these differences. Adoption of private sector practices, including improved administrative support and autonomy, as well as public-private partnerships, may enhance retention and wellbeing in the public system.</p>

<h2 id="article-3">3. How should New Zealand health professionals respond to Trump 2.0?</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: The New Zealand medical journal

<h3 id="摘要-2">摘要</h3>
<p>Donald J Trump began his second term as president of the United States (US) in January 2025. Since then, his administration has abandoned the precedents necessary for good government, brushed aside restrictions on executive power, sacked tens of thousands of federal workers and undermined healthcare within the US and overseas. I argue the consequences of Trump’s actions are so serious they must concern health professionals everywhere, and outline three ways to respond. These are: to actively and effectively support colleagues in the US; to do what we can to sustain health gains worldwide; and to oppose health-damaging Trump-like thinking in Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>

<h2 id="article-4">4. Climate change impacts on health in Aotearoa New Zealand: a scoping review.</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: The New Zealand medical journal
<strong>发表日期</strong>: 2025-Oct-10
<strong>链接</strong>: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41066782">PubMed</a></p>

<h3 id="摘要-3">摘要</h3>
<p>This paper addresses the evidence on the health impacts of climate change in Aotearoa New Zealand with particular attention to who, where and what activities are most vulnerable. Applying the Arksey and O’Malley scoping review framework, it consolidates academic and grey literature to identify gaps and future research priorities. The review-conducted from February to October 2024-included 61 papers from 2,265 that were initially screened. The results reveal that temperature and extreme precipitation are the main climate risks associated with health in Aotearoa New Zealand. These are associated with direct and indirect impacts, including heat-related illness and death, enteric diseases, poor mental health, access to safe drinking water/food supplies and access to healthcare. Most regions across Aotearoa New Zealand are susceptible to climate change-induced health risks, with unique pressures for coastal regions, metropolitan areas, rural areas and regions experiencing disproportionate socio-economic inequity. Workers in outdoor manual labour-exposed to heat stress, air pollution and sun damage-are vulnerable to climate change-induced health risks. The review also highlights key demographic characteristics-ethnicity, age, skin colour, occupation, gender, housing, disability and pre-existing health needs, and socio-economic deprivation-that affect vulnerability. In conclusion, the review underscores the importance of responses to climate change-induced health addressing the underlying, intersectional risk factors to protect vulnerable populations.</p>

<h2 id="article-5">5. Eating disorder risk in transgender youth and its association with unmet need for gender-affirming hormone therapy in Aotearoa New Zealand: a cross-sectional study.</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: The New Zealand medical journal
<strong>发表日期</strong>: 2025-Oct-10

<h3 id="摘要-4">摘要</h3>
<p>This study aimed to estimate rates and factors associated with eating disorder risk in transgender youth, and to explore the association between this risk and unmet need for gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT).
In a national cross-sectional survey of participants aged 14-24 years, the five-item Sick, Control, One stone, Fat, Food (SCOFF) instrument was used to assess eating disorder risk. GAHT demand was self-reported. Modified Poisson regressions were employed to assess risk.
Overall, 1,401 participants were eligible, of whom 1,010 (72.1%) had valid SCOFF scores. Of these, 398 (38.4%) participants met the threshold for eating disorder risk. In adjusted analyses, those aged 14-18 years had an increased prevalence ratio (PR) of eating disorder risk compared with their counterparts aged 19-24 years (PR: 1.26; 95% confidence interval: 1.06-1.50). GAHT demand was reported by 645 participants, with 277 (42.9%) having unmet need. No statistical evidence was found relating unmet GAHT need with eating disorder risk (p=0.29).
Nearly two in five transgender youth are at eating disorder risk, and unmet GAHT need rates appear higher. While it is recognised that eating disorders are a global health concern, they have not received the priority they deserve. In the calls for urgent action, transgender youth deserve particular attention.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-6">摘要</h3>
<p>To describe Health New Zealand - Te Whatu Ora rheumatology services across Aotearoa New Zealand using the Arthritis New Zealand/New Zealand Rheumatology Association-endorsed rheumatology service standards.
Descriptive study with data collection by survey from clinical service leads from all 16 Health New Zealand - Te Whatu Ora rheumatology services.
Response rate was 100%. No services met all the service standards. Staffing of rheumatologists approached the standards in only three services, and nursing staffing was well below the standards in all services, with two services not employing any nurses. Where nurses were employed, nursing services standards were largely met. Five services did not provide inpatient consultations. Almost all services had access to conventional imaging modalities, but less than half of services provided point-of-care ultrasounds or had access to fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). Most services were able to make referrals to physiotherapy, occupational therapy and hand therapy. Ability of services to meet care standards for the care of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was variable. Between 2023 and 2025, two services had a substantive increase in rheumatologist staffing and two had a substantive increase in nursing staffing.
This first national-level description of all Health New Zealand - Te Whatu Ora rheumatology services found considerable heterogeneity, and generally services did not meet all services standards.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-7">摘要</h3>
<p>Skin-to-skin care (SSC) improves health outcomes in preterm infants. Given its benefits, it is crucial to understand the facilitators and barriers that influence its implementation within the socio-ecological model (SEM), which considers the intrapersonal, interpersonal, institutional, community, and policy-level factors.
This integrative review employed the SEM for synthesis and evaluation of the evidence surrounding facilitators and barriers for providing SSC with preterm infants and parents in the NICU.
PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and EMBASE were searched for relevant studies among mothers of preterm infants (&lt;37 weeks’ gestation). All information was extracted for analysis and synthesized in alignment within the levels of the SEM.
This review identified 5 levels of influence that either promote or hinder SSC in NICUs: (1) Intrapersonal, including maternal stress and infant characteristics such as weight and gestational age; (2) Interpersonal, focusing on family support and peer interactions; (3) Institutional, addressing the impact of hospital facilities and space limitations; (4) Community, considering cultural beliefs and societal norms; and (5) Public Policy, highlighting guidelines and policies.
To improve SSC implementation in NICUs, it is essential that health care providers focus on individualized care, privacy, cultural sensitivity, and staff education. Future research needs to focus on implementation strategies facilitating SSC while decreasing barriers, as well as outcomes associated with SSC across diverse NICU settings.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-9">摘要</h3>
<p>Studies have shown that rural populations were less likely than urban populations to use telemedicine during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. These trends are not well characterized nationally for patients with cancer.
This cohort analysis, using 2 years of Medicare fee-for-service claims (2020-2021), identified patients with incident or prevalent lung or colon cancer in 2020. Rurality of patient residence was classified using rural-urban commuting area codes as metropolitan, micropolitan, or small town/rural. We used generalized estimating equations to model outpatient (telemedicine and in-person) visit trends in 2020 and 2021 by rurality, adjusting for local COVID-19 rates, US region, and clinical and demographic factors.
We identified 355,868 patients (66% lung, 34% colon). Median age was 76 years (standard deviation [SD], 7). 78% of patients lived in metropolitan areas, 85% were White, and 53% female. 44% had at least one instance of chemotherapy, surgery, or radiation treatment in 2020. In 2020, compared with patients residing in metropolitan areas, small town/rural-residing patients were less likely to use telemedicine (1.28 visits per year [95% CI, 1.27 to 1.29] v 2.34 [95% CI, 2.33 to 2.35] for metropolitan patients), had fewer total outpatient in-person visits (12.37 [95% CI, 12.34 to 12.41] v 13.71 [95% CI, 13.70 to 13.72]), and had more emergency department (ED) visits (0.85 [95% CI, 0.84 to 0.86] v 0.48 [95% CI, 0.48 to 0.48]) while inpatient utilization was similar. Similar trends were seen in 2021 and by cancer type.
Lower rural telemedicine use continued beyond the pandemic onset. Relatively lower in-person and higher ED use suggests that telemedicine expansion did not improve overall access to care for rural patients with cancer.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-10">摘要</h3>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of infection control practices in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs). This study examined SNF administrator perspectives on implementing built environment strategies to manage and mitigate COVID-19 transmission into and within their facility. Semi-structured interviews with SNF administrators were conducted between July 2020-December 2021. Administrators emphasized (1) the effective implementation of built environment strategies for quarantine and isolation protocols, (2) facility-level modifications used to manage and mitigate COVID-19 transmission, and (3) the challenges posed by outdated or high-density building layouts. Insights from this study’s findings suggest important considerations for SNF architectural modifications and design as a mechanism for infection control. Thoughtful SNF architectural planning and design are critically important for the long-term care industry to expand and successfully meet the future challenges of pandemics, severe weather events, and other public health emergencies.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-11">摘要</h3>
<p>Despite rapid population aging, the situation of older adults in Ethiopia has received limited attention from policymakers, leaving older adults with little to no social protection. To understand the impact of the lack of a basic income benefit, this study explored the perspectives of retired pensioners on late life precarity in Addis Ababa. An exploratory descriptive study using interviews and focus group discussions was conducted with 31 retirees age 60 + . Data were analyzed thematically. The findings highlight five major life challenges of retirees leading to precarious lives in Ethiopia: unattended health issues and unaffordable health care; absence of recreational places; lack of respect and feeling disengaged; vulnerable livelihoods; and overlooked value and contribution of older adults. The findings underscore the need to employ intersectional perspectives in future studies for better understanding of inequality and inequity in aging in resource-poor contexts. Furthermore, the findings underline the need for national policies aimed at improving the well-being and quality of life of both retirees and all older adults. By implementing a social protection policy, creating elder-focused community centers, and implementing sustainable income-generating initiatives, Ethiopia can ensure that older citizens receive the necessary support needed to thrive and enjoy a fulfilling late life.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-13">摘要</h3>
<p>This study examined the applicability of the Decomposed Theory of Planned Behavior (DTPB) in understanding long-term care residents’ intention to continue using an augmented reality (AR) aromatherapy education program designed to manage behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Eighty-five residents participated in a cross-sectional survey following their experience with a series of AR-based modules. Partial least squares structural equation modeling showed that attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control significantly predicted continuous use intention, explaining 69.0% of the variance. Perceived usefulness and playfulness shaped attitude, while interpersonal influence and self-efficacy influenced subjective norms and perceived behavioral control, respectively. Perceived usefulness demonstrated both direct and indirect effects on use intention. Findings support the theoretical fit of the DTPB in evaluating technology-based interventions for older adults. Integration of AR aromatherapy education into long-term care may enhance resident engagement and support non-pharmacological BPSD management.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-14">摘要</h3>
<p>Nurses play a pivotal role in health care delivery and health education. However, their demanding work environments, characterized by irregular shifts and high stress, often hinder their ability to adopt healthy lifestyles, compromising both their well-being and their effectiveness as role models for health promotion. With the rise of digital health technologies, eHealth literacy-the capacity to seek, evaluate, and apply online health information-has emerged as a critical factor influencing health-promoting behaviors among health care professionals.
This study aims to examine the association between eHealth literacy and healthy lifestyle behaviors among Iranian nurses, focusing on nutrition, physical activity, stress management, health responsibility, interpersonal relations, and spiritual growth.
We conducted a cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study in Tehran, Iran, from November 2024 to February 2025. A total of 334 registered nurses from 7 public and teaching hospitals participated. Data were collected via the eHealth Literacy Scale and the Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile II. Spearman correlation and multivariate linear regression analyses were performed, with statistical significance set at P&lt;.05.
Of 334 nurses, 234 (70.1%) had moderate eHealth literacy, 178 (53.3%) had good healthy lifestyle scores, and none scored low. A significant positive correlation was found between eHealth literacy and overall healthy lifestyle (r=0.565; P&lt;.001), with the strongest associations observed for spiritual growth (r=0.537), health responsibility (r=0.437), and interpersonal relationships (r=0.467). Associations with stress management (r=0.318), nutrition (r=0.321), and physical activity (r=0.289) were weaker but remained statistically substantial.
Higher eHealth literacy is associated with healthier lifestyles, particularly in the areas of spiritual growth and health responsibility. Workplace barriers, such as rotating shifts, limit physical activity and stress management. Targeted eHealth training and wellness programs are needed.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-15">摘要</h3>
<p>The advent of robotic total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in the field of orthopedics has caused much discussion on social media. As social media grows, its platforms are becoming an increasingly popular medium for health care-related discussions.
This study aimed to better understand the current public discussion about robotic TKA on social media. We aimed to characterize these discussions by analyzing their contributors, the general sentiment, the temporal trends, and the content.
A comprehensive search of the Twitter database for academic research was performed from inception (March 2006) to April 1, 2023, to identify all tweets related to robotic TKA. General data regarding the tweets and the accounts were retrieved. ChatGPT-4o (OpenAI) was used to categorize the post’s content and the accounts into different categories developed via iterative testing. The content was categorized using a rule-based classification algorithm developed using Python to assign categories based on keyword presence, phrase matching, and syntactic patterns. Regarding the accounts, an automated keyword-based rule engine was implemented in Python to classify accounts based on the account’s name and description. We used a lexicon-based natural language processing Python library, via ChatGPT-4o, to assign a sentiment to the tweets and conducted subgroup sentiment analysis.
A total of 2000 tweets were retrieved for analysis. Account analysis revealed that the most prevalent account categories were “medical professionals” (619/2000, 31.0%), “patients and community” (274/2000, 13.7%), and “media and publications” (268/2000, 13.4%). Content analysis revealed that the most prevalent tweet themes were “technology and innovation” (550/2000, 27.5%), “advertising and promotion” (176/2000, 8.8%), and “research and data” (172/2000, 8.6%). Sentiment analysis showed that 61.6% (1231/2000) of the tweets had a positive sentiment, while 9.2% (183/2000) were neutral, and 29.3% (586/2000) had a negative sentiment. Accounts categorized as “institutions” had the highest prevalence of positive sentiment (165/229, 72.1%), while accounts categorized as “media and publications” had the highest prevalence of negative sentiment (88/268, 32.8%). The number of tweets relating to robotic TKA has been steadily rising since 2016, with a peak incidence of 402 (20.1%) tweets published in 2022.
The increased number of tweets with a positive sentiment suggests a positive outlook toward robotic TKA. Institutions had the highest prevalence of positive sentiment, suggesting a possible bias toward positive reporting of robotic TKA, likely for commercial reasons. Media and publications had the highest prevalence of negative sentiment, which may represent skepticism and bias toward negative reporting on robotic technologies in health care. Medical professionals contributed significantly to the discussion about robotic TKA, while patient involvement was relatively small. The number of tweets relating to robotic TKA has been steadily growing since 2016, which indicates that robotic TKA has been gaining in popularity over recent years.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-16">摘要</h3>
<p>Background: The prevalence of substance misuse among young people, and the risks associated with it, emphasize the need for targeted prevention efforts. Understanding factors that impact communities’ readiness to implement successful prevention programs is critical to addressing this need effectively. Objectives: The purpose of this paper is to identify predictors of community readiness (CR) for substance misuse prevention by examining relationships between readiness and (1) community type, (2) community attitudes, (3) barriers and facilitators, and (4) town ability to implement activities. The authors used data from a 2022 Connecticut-wide key informant survey that assessed community level readiness to implement behavioral health prevention and promotion activities. Results: ANOVA indicated that rural communities had a significantly lower mean CR stage (MR = 4.1, SDR = 1.8) than other community types. Three linear regression models found the following to be significantly and positively associated with CR stage: community residents’ concern about prevention (b = 0.35), knowledge about community programs (b = 0.27), political support for prevention (b = 0.23), data to determine the extent of the issue (b = 0.41), the community’s ability to collect local data (b = 0.64), and raise community awareness (b = 0.48). Conclusions: Findings suggest areas where prevention practitioners could increase focus in order to improve readiness to implement prevention practices related to substance misuse, including bolstering community capacity to collect data, educating residents, and increasing community members’ knowledge, awareness, and concern about substance misuse.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-17">摘要</h3>
<p>The Spanish Society of Digestive Diseases (SEPD) and the Spanish Association of Digestive Ultrasound (AEED), as leading scientific societies in the field of Gastroenterology in Spain, have among their core objectives the continuous improvement of clinical practice, the training of specialists, and the promotion of diagnostic and therapeutic tools that contribute to higher quality, more efficient, and patient-centered healthcare. As a guarantor of the professional development of specialists, SEPD also acts as a technical liaison with health authorities, advocating for the recognition of competencies based on scientific evidence and real healthcare needs. Likewise, AEED is committed to advancing the use of ultrasound techniques, as well as research and training in ultrasound techniques. Both societies consider it essential to establish clinical ultrasound as a core competency of the gastroenterologist. This need arises from a clinical and educational reality strongly supported by scientific evidence, the current regulatory framework, and accumulated experience in other countries and specialties. In this context, SEPD and AEED issue this position statement to reinforce the role of clinical ultrasound as an essential skill of the digestive system specialist. This position is not driven by corporate interests but by an academic, responsible vision that serves patients and the healthcare system. It is further justified by growing scientific evidence, regulatory and training support, and the urgent need to ensure equal access to this technique in all Gastroenterology departments across the country, avoiding unjustified inequalities between regions or hospitals. It also seeks to address organizational gaps where ultrasound remains restricted to other specialties, even when the overall care of the patient lies with the gastroenterologist.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-18">摘要</h3>
<p>This study investigated the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the right cerebellar hemisphere on visuomotor adaptation and interlimb coordination learning. Specifically, we examined the impact of cerebellar stimulation on the acquisition of new visuomotor transformations and subsequent adaptation under interference conditions during a bimanual tracking task. A total of 42 healthy adults performed a bimanual visuomotor tracking task in which the left and right hands controlled horizontal and vertical cursor movements, respectively. The experiment consisted of two phases: (1) an Initial learning phase involving adaptation to a visuomotor transformation, and (2) an Interference adaptation phase, defined as adaptation to a new visuomotor mapping under interference from the previously learned transformation, in which only the right-hand mapping was altered. Participants received either active or sham 1Hz rTMS over the right cerebellar hemisphere before the task. Performance was assessed using tracking error and interlimb error structure measures. Tracking errors decreased over trials in both learning phases. While rTMS had no significant effect during the Initial learning phase, it significantly reduced tracking errors during the Interference adaptation phase. In the active-rTMS group, interlimb error correlation and the directional error slope also declined across trials, suggesting reduced cross-limb interference and enhanced coordination flexibility. These findings suggest that cerebellar rTMS facilitates the adaptation of altered visuomotor mappings, particularly during interference adaptation, by modulating interlimb coordination. The results support the hypothesis that bimanual coordination relies on modular internal models that dynamically interact during motor learning. This study underscores the cerebellum’s essential role in optimizing interlimb adaptation, especially under interference adaptation, and highlights the potential of cerebellar neuromodulation for motor rehabilitation.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-19">摘要</h3>
<p>In recent years, skeletal muscle has been recognized not only as a locomotor organ but also as a secretory organ. The bioactive molecules it releases, known as myokines, act on distant organs through the circulation and locally on muscle tissue. Previously, we identified R-spondin 3 (Rspo3) as a Type I fiber-specific myokine that promotes myoblast differentiation into Type I fibers in vitro. In this study, we further investigated whether Rspo3 is involved in regulating Type I fiber determination in vivo.
We generated tamoxifen-induced muscle-specific Rspo3-deficient mice and found that Rspo3 deficiency impaired Type I fiber determination during muscle regeneration. In contrast, transient overexpression of Rspo3 through in vivo electroporation enhanced the regeneration of Type I fibers, supporting its functional role in fiber-type specification.
This work reveals that Rspo3 as a Type I fiber specific myokine promotes Type I fiber determination during muscle regeneration in vivo.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-20">摘要</h3>
<p>To assess the frequency of super-responders (≥ 75% reduction in migraine frequency) and absolute responders (100% reduction) to monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) after one year of treatment in individuals with high frequency (HFEM) or chronic migraine (CM).
This multicenter (n = 16), prospective, real-life study, involved consecutive adults with HFEM or CM and ≥ 3 prior preventive failures, receiving subcutaneous anti-CGRP mAbs for ≥ 12 months. Co-primary endpoints were the 12-month rates of super- and absolute responders. Secondary endpoints included subgroup analyses by migraine type and timing of response, categorized as early (≤ 3 months), late (&gt; 3-6 month), or ultra-late (&gt; 6-12 month).
572 patients completed 12 months of treatment: 70.0% achieved super-response (HFEM: 64.9%; CM: 71.8%) and 23.4% absolute response (HFEM: 29.9%; CM: 21.0%). Both outcomes exhibited a time-dependent progression. Among super-responders (n = 400), 29.4% were early, 22.6% late, and 18.0% ultra-late. Among absolute responders (n = 134), 3.1% responded early, 3.7% late, and 16.6% ultra-late.
One year of anti-CGRP mAbs therapy yields a ≥ 75% response in over two-thirds and a 100% response in nearly one-quarter of patients with HFEM or CM and prior treatment failures. Most super- and absolute responses emerge after six months, supporting long-term continuation treatment.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-21">摘要</h3>
<p>The GDF15-GFRaL-RET signaling complex is involved in a broad range of disease states, with agonistic action of GDF15 affecting metabolism and body weight control, while inhibition is indicated in cancer and wasting disorders like cachexia. Here, we describe the discovery of the peptide inhibitors of the GDF15-GFRaL protein-protein interaction to prevent RET-induced signaling using both a structure-guided design and a phage display approach. Phage display provided bicyclic peptide hits with high affinity for GFRaL, and these were dimerized to mimic the bidentate interaction of homodimeric GDF15. Guided by structural data, the monomeric peptides were converted into tandem Bicycle molecules with picomolar affinities, similar to that of the endogenous GDF15 ligand. These dimerized protein mimetics inhibited cell signaling in a functional assay and showed improved pharmacokinetic properties compared with their monomeric counterparts. This is the first example of a homodimeric Bicycle molecule inhibiting receptor complex formation, thereby antagonizing the intracellular signaling response.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-22">摘要</h3>
<p>Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a global health concern requiring a risk assessment framework based on systematic factors analysis for prevention and control.
This study aims to construct a comprehensive HFMD risk assessment framework by integrating multisource data, including historical incidence information, environmental parameters, and web-based search behavior data, to improve predictive performance.
We integrated multisource data (HFMD cases, meteorology, air pollution, Baidu Index, and public health measures) from Bao’an District of Shenzhen city in Southern China (2014-2023). Correlation analysis was used to assess the associations between HFMD incidence and systematic factors. The impacts of environmental factors were analyzed using the Distributed Lag Nonlinear Model. Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model and advanced machine learning methods were used to predict HFMD 1-4 weeks ahead. Risk levels for the 1- to 4-week-ahead forecasts were determined by comparing the predicted weekly incidence against predefined thresholds.
From 2014 to 2023, Bao’an District reported a total of 118,826 cases of HFMD. Environmental and search behavior factors (excluding sulfur dioxide) were significantly associated with HFMD incidence in nonlinear patterns. For 1-week-ahead prediction, Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average using case data alone performed best (R²=0.95, r=0.98, mean absolute error=53.34, and root-mean-square error=99.31). For 2- to 4-week-ahead forecasting, machine learning models incorporating web-based and environmental data showed superior performance (R²=0.83, 0.75, and 0.64; r=0.92, 0.87, and 0.80; mean absolute error=87.84, 112.41, and 132.47; and root-mean-square error=185.08, 229.13, and 276.81). The predicted HFMD risk levels matched the observed levels with accuracies of 96%, 87%, 88%, and 83%, respectively.
The epidemic dynamics of HFMD are influenced by multiple factors in a nonlinear manner. Integrating multisource data, particularly web-based search behavior, significantly enhances the accuracy of short- and midterm forecasts and risk assessment. This approach offers practical insights for developing digital surveillance and early warning systems in public health.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-23">摘要</h3>
<p>In Guinea, N’Zérékoré region has historically been endemic for both Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium. Following eight years of mass treatment with praziquantel to treat schistosomiasis, as part of a multi-country project, the country was selected to pilot the Schistosomiasis Practical and Precision Assessment (SPPA) approach. The SPPA pilot was conducted in five health districts in the forest region. The main objectives were to determine the current infection status and treatment strategy for each health sub-district and to evaluate the feasibility of the SPPA approach.
A cross-sectional study among children aged 10-14 years of age was conducted. In each health district, a systematic sample of 15 schools were selected with 32 school children selected randomly from each. Stool and urine samples were collected from each child. Two Kato-Katz slides were examined for S. mansoni and soil transmitted helminthiasis (STH) and one urine filtration slide and one hemastix for S. haematobium infections and microhaematuria, respectively. Of the 2400 children targeted for inclusion, 2325 provided samples (96.9%). The combined prevalence of Schistosoma species across the five health districts was 66.4%. S. mansoni had a high prevalence of 66.1% with four health districts above 50%. S. haematobium had a low prevalence of 4.3%. The overall prevalence of any combined STH (Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura or hookworm) was 11.7%. Sex, age and contact with a freshwater body during the last week before the survey, were not statistically significant in their association with schistosomiasis.
The results of the SPPA indicate that schistosomiasis remains homogeneously high across all five health districts. Consequently, it is recommended to maintain annual treatment in each sub-health district, and to extend treatment to whole communities aged two years of age and over, while strengthening critical cross-sectoral interventions such as behaviour change and environmental management.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-24">摘要</h3>
<p>Fluorouracil (5-FU) belongs to the class of fluorouracil compounds and is commonly used as an anticancer drug for various types of cancer treatment. It inhibits tumor growth by blocking DNA synthesis and cell proliferation, thereby exerting anticancer effects. 5-fluorouracil is commonly used in combination with other chemotherapy drugs to enhance its curative effects and can be administered orally or intravenously. Despite its high bioavailability and tissue distribution rate, 5-fluorouracil may also cause a series of adverse reactions including gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) and bone marrow suppression. The skin is not only the largest organ of the human body but also highly susceptible to external environmental factors and internal influences. Many chronic skin conditions, such as eczema, psoriasis, and skin cancer, can impact the health and youthful appearance of the skin. 5-FU can alleviate inflammation by inhibiting cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis, and suppressing DNA synthesis, thereby treating keloids and other skin issues. Maintaining skin health and adopting effective treatment measures for skin diseases are effective ways to delay skin aging. This study explores the therapeutic potential of fluorouracil in addressing skin aging and diseases, providing new ideas for anti-aging treatments.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-25">摘要</h3>
<p>Cognitive training is an effective approach to support cognitive function in older adults. Incorporating meaningful leisure activities, such as gardening, may enhance both engagement and training outcomes. While fully immersive virtual reality (VR) offers ecologically valid and engaging environments that can further boost motivation, limited research has explored the combination of VR-based cognitive training and leisure activities for older adults.
This study aims to assess the feasibility, usability, and preliminary effectiveness of leisure-based VR cognitive training for community-dwelling older adults.
A fully immersive VR cognitive training system, controlled via a head-mounted display, was developed, incorporating gardening-themed activities such as planting, fertilizing, watering, and harvesting. These tasks were designed to engage multiple cognitive domains, including memory, attention, executive function, processing speed, and visuospatial abilities. The program consisted of 16 sessions delivered over 8 weeks (twice weekly, 1 hour per session). Cognitive outcomes were assessed before and after training using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, the digit symbol substitution test, word list immediate and delayed recall, spatial span, and the Stroop Color and Word Test. Feasibility, acceptance, and usability were evaluated using the System Usability Scale and a posttraining questionnaire. Licensed occupational therapists from both community and institutional settings assessed the training system’s usability.
All 41 participants (mean age 69.79, SD 5.05 y) completed the training with 100% adherence and no serious adverse events. Feasibility ratings-particularly for perceived usefulness, intention to use, and subjective norms-reflected strong acceptance. Usability ratings from older adults indicated high ease of use, enjoyment, and positive experience, while professionals rated the system as moderately usable (mean System Usability Scale score 68.01, SD 8.38). Statistically significant improvements were observed in general cognition (P=.004), processing speed (P=.049), immediate and delayed memory (P&lt;.001), and executive function (P=.002). No significant changes were found in visuospatial memory (P=.29).
This study provides preliminary evidence supporting the feasibility and usability of a gardening-based VR cognitive training program for older adults. Feasibility was demonstrated through full adherence, absence of major adverse events, and high participant acceptance. Usability feedback was favorable from both older adults and professionals across community and long term care settings. Additionally, improvements in multiple cognitive domains, including general cognition, processing speed, memory, and executive function, suggest potential cognitive benefits. Future randomized controlled trials with more diverse samples and extended follow-up are warranted to confirm and expand upon these findings.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-26">摘要</h3>
<p>This study examined the relationship between participation in cognitive activities (CA), the risk of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD), and the residential setting using Health and Retirement Study data from 2012 to 2020 (n = 18,111). A Cox proportional hazards regression model assessed risk factors. Findings revealed that residential setting significantly predicted dementia risk. Older adults living in nursing homes were 3.57 times more likely to develop AD/ADRD than those residing in the community (95% CI [2.23, 5.07]). Although both groups showed reduced risk with increased CA participation, community dwellers experienced a 12% risk reduction compared to only 2% among nursing home residents, even when both participated in cognitive activities three to four times per week. These results underscore the dual importance of engaging in cognitive activities and considering environmental context in mitigating AD/ADRD risk among older adults.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-28">摘要</h3>
<p>Exploring the relationship between parenting styles and negative emotions among secondary school students in southern Anhui Province from a network analysis perspective.
A random stratified cluster sampling method was employed to select 2135 secondary school students from five secondary schools in three cities in southern Anhui Province-Ma’anshan, Tongling, and Xuancheng-as the study subjects. Questionnaire surveys were conducted using the DASS-21 scale and the Revised short from of the Egna Minnen av Barndoms Uppfostran (s-EMBU-C). Network models were constructed with R software, and data analysis was conducted with SPSS 26.0.
Parental emotional warmth was negatively correlated with students’ negative emotions (P &lt; 0.01), while parental rejection and overprotection showed positive correlations (P &lt; 0.01). The negative emotion network model shows that Dep-DASS7 and Stress-DASS4 are the core symptoms of negative emotions. In the network structure of parenting styles, the negative emotions are influenced by the emotional warmth of parents through the nodes of Dep-DASS3 and Stress-DASS6 nodes to influence the negative emotion network. This indicates that negative emotions and parenting styles are interconnected rather than independent.
Dep-DASS7 and Stress-DASS4 are core symptoms, and using them as intervention targets can significantly reduce the occurrence of negative emotions among secondary school students. Parenting styles can influence the structure of the negative emotion network through the contact points of Dep-DASS3 and Stress-DASS6, thereby providing a scientific basis for preventing and improving the relationship between parents and secondary school students.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-29">摘要</h3>
<p>This study aimed to examine the relationship between online sexual abuse exposure, risky sexual behaviors, and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) symptoms in adolescents diagnosed with ADHD. The research included 118 adolescents with ADHD and 117 healthy controls, all assessed by child psychiatrists using the ‘Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children’ (K-SADS) to confirm diagnoses, comorbid conditions. This cross-sectional, epidemiological study utilized sociodemographic data forms, the Online Sexual Abuse Scale, and the Conners Parent Rating Scale for data collection. Online sexual abuse was categorized into four subtypes: online sexual victimization, receiving sexually explicit messages (passive sexting), sending sexually explicit messages (active sexting), and online sexual bullying behavior. Data analysis using logistic regression revealed that academic failure independently increased the likelihood of engaging in risky sexual behaviors by 2.1 times in both ADHD and control groups, underscoring the critical role of academic performance in moderating online sexual risk exposure. The ADHD group exhibited a significantly higher prevalence of online sexual abuse compared to controls (50 % vs. 31.6 %). Specifically, rates of online sexual victimization (33.1 % vs. 17.1 %) and passive sexting (38.1 % vs. 23.9 %) were notably higher among adolescents with ADHD. Older adolescents in the ADHD group showed increased rates of passive sexting, while girls experienced higher rates of online sexual victimization compared to boys. Furthermore, treatment status, duration of ADHD diagnosis, and medication use were examined in relation to online sexual behaviors. The impact of untreated ADHD was evident, with untreated individuals demonstrating a higher risk of both victimization and perpetration in online settings. This highlights the urgent need for targeted interventions to mitigate these risks in ADHD populations. The long-term consequences of online sexual abuse in adolescents are profound, contributing to increased psychosocial dysfunction, emotional distress, and potential trajectories toward antisocial behaviors. Given that a significant proportion of incarcerated individuals exhibit undiagnosed or untreated ADHD, early identification and intervention are crucial to preventing both victimization and perpetration in digital environments. Failure to address ADHD-related impulsivity and risky behaviors could lead to an alarming overrepresentation of individuals with ADHD in online sexual exploitation cases. In conclusion, adolescents with ADHD face a disproportionately higher risk of online sexual abuse compared to their peers. Targeted prevention strategies, early intervention, and comprehensive ADHD management-including educational support and treatment-are essential to reducing this risk. Future studies should further investigate the mechanisms underlying these associations to develop more effective preventive strategies.</p>

<p>Studies in temperate regions have observed an increased risk of preeclampsia in the winter, while studies conducted in tropical regions have found an increased risk during the rainy season. The effectof season of conception and delivery have been inconsistent and poorly studied in moderate climates such as Los Angeles.
We aimed to study the effects of the season of delivery on the risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.
We conducted a retrospective cohort study among 24,843 predominantly Hispanic womenwho delivered at a large, urban safety nethospital from1995 and 2008. Logistic regression and multivariable multinomial logistic regression were used to estimateodds ratios and 95% CIs.
Mothers who delivered in the wet season had a significantly increased risk of developing hypertensive disorders of pregnancy compared to those who delivered in the dry season (OR = 1.11, 95 % CI: 1.02, 1.21). When stratifying based on disease severity, only mild preeclampsia indicated an association with season of delivery (OR = 1.12, 95 % CI: 1.01, 1.25). The effect for severe preeclampsia (OR = 1.12, 95 % Cl: 0.96, 1.31) and eclampsia/HELLP syndrome (OR = 0.80, 95 % CI: 0.49, 1.31) did not reach statistical significance, though power was limited in the more severe categories. Results evaluating season of conception as the outcome were similar to those for the season of delivery.
Among the predominantly Hispanic women who delivered at Los Angeles County + University of Southern California between 1995 and 2008, deliveries in the wet, winter season were associated with an increased risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-31">摘要</h3>
<p>Environmental factors play a critical role in the pathogenesis of abnormal blood glucose and its complications. However, research on the relationship between environmental factors, blood glucose, and mortality is limited. Using NHANES (1999-2018) data, we analyzed the association between serum Cd concentrations and all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in abnormal blood glucose individuals through multivariate weighted Cox proportional hazards models. Dose-response relationships were assessed using restricted cubic splines, and interaction effects between Cd exposure and other factors were also explored. Among 11,836 participants, 2379 deaths occurred. After full adjustment, high Cd concentrations significantly increased all-cause (HR=1.55, 95 % CI: 1.26-1.91) and CVD mortality (HR=1.58, 95 % CI: 1.12-2.21) in individuals with abnormal blood glucose. Cd exhibited a nonlinear positive association with all-cause mortality (Pnonlinear=0.011) and a linear association with CVD mortality (Pnonlinear=0.224). Stratified analysis showed a stronger association in prediabetes (pre-DM) than diabetes mellitus (DM) (Pfor interaction&lt;0.001 for all-cause mortality, Pfor interaction=0.026 for CVD mortality). A threshold effect was observed at 0.62 µg/L in pre-DM population, above which the risk of all-cause mortality increased markedly. Moreover, high Cd and hypertension exhibited a significant synergistic effect on all-cause mortality (Pfor interaction=0.047). Cd concentration is positively associated with mortality in individuals with abnormal blood glucose, particularly in the pre-DM population. These findings suggest that monitoring environmental pollutants such as Cd in the pre-DM population is crucial. Additionally, controlling blood glucose and blood pressure in populations with occupational exposure to heavy metals, such as Cd, is emphasized as an important public health measure.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-32">摘要</h3>
<p>Persistent exposure to arsenic (As) through contaminated rice poses severe public health risks. This study combined pot and field experiments to evaluate the effects of water regimes-continuous flooding (F), intermittent irrigation with prolonged dry periods (I), and moistening irrigation (M)-in combination with phosphorus fertilizers: calcium magnesium phosphate (CMP) and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (ADP). The IADP treatment (I + ADP) achieved the highest soil pe+pH (averaging 8.33), reducing porewater As by 27-81 % and DGT-labile As by 30-70 % by inhibiting Fe(III) reductive dissolution and enhancing As sequestration into Fe (hydr)oxides. Microbial analyses indicated that IADP significantly altered the rhizobacterial communities. Functional predictions using BugBase and FAPROTAX suggested IADP with high pe+pH conditions enhanced stress-tolerant phenotypes and S-cycle bacteria while reducing N-cycle bacteria. Moreover, IADP promoted the growth of As(III)-oxidizing bacteria (e.g., Gemmatimonadaceae). These changes in bacterial communities not only contributed to the immobilization of soil As but also affected plant nutrient uptake. Path analysis confirmed that the suppression of As bioavailability was primarily driven by elevated pe+pH and microbially facilitated As stabilization. Consequently, IADP reduced inorganic As (iAs) in grains to 0.13 mg kg⁻¹ , 12-76 % lower than other treatments. Field validation further demonstrated that IADP consistently decreased iAs in brown rice to 0.10-0.13 mg kg⁻¹ , complying with Chinese food safety standards (GB2762-2022) without compromising yield. This study revealed insights into how redox-microbial interactions reduced As bioavailability and identified IADP as a well-defined, sustainable and practical strategy for safe rice production.</p>

<p>Arsenic，a well-documented environmental contaminant, has been associated with hepatic metabolism dysregulation. Previous study found arsenic exposure during pregnancy induced hepatic lipid accumulation in female offspring through α-ketoglutarate(α-KG) reduction. However, the mechanism of arsenic-reduced α-KG content remains unclear. In this study, in vivo experiments were conducted to investigate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress activation in arsenic-exposed offspring, while experiments in vitro were to investigate the role of ER stress in arsenic-reduced α-KG content. Our findings revealed gestational arsenic exposure reduced the hepatic α-KG level in male offspring. Mechanistically, arsenic exposure triggered ER stress, as evidenced by the activation of ER stress sensor inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α). To confirm the effect of ER stress in arsenic impeded α-KG content, 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA), an accepted inhibitor of ER stress, was used to treat AML12 cells. The results showed 4-PBA pretreatment upregulated the expression of α-KG synthase and mitigated the depletion of α-KG content. Moreover, IRE1α siRNA pretreatment markedly reversed arsenic-reduced α-KG content in AML12 cells. As above, Arsenic exposure reduced α-KG content via activating IRE1α signaling. ER stress maybe the potential mechanism of arsenic exposure impaired α-KG level in male offspring. This study provided novel insights into the toxicological mechanisms whereby maternal environmental exposure programed metabolic disorders in offspring.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-34">摘要</h3>
<p>Disruption of cellular energy metabolism is tied to serious health conditions, with the liver playing a critical role. Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) and its alternatives, tetrachlorobisphenol A (TCBPA) and tetrabromobisphenol S (TBBPS), are flame retardants recognized for their hepatotoxicity; however, their effects on cellular energy metabolism remain inadequately elucidated. To address this, we utilized targeted metabolomics to quantify energy-related metabolites in HepG2 exposed to TBBPA and its alternatives at environmentally relevant concentrations. The exposures significantly increased α-ketoglutarate, ATP, and ADP levels, coupled with reductions in glucose 6-phosphate. The activation of the TCA cycle was substantiated by increases in nearly all associated metabolites in cells. Additionally, through the application of 3D principal component analysis and the construction of a metabolites-molecular descriptors correlation network, we recognized that Chi path descriptors, gravitational index descriptors, and moment of inertia descriptors of TBBPA and its alternatives differ from those of organic pollutants known to suppress the TCA cycle. This study underscores the disruptive impact of TBBPA and its alternatives on cellular energy metabolism, providing critical insights into their potential contributions to metabolic disorders and highlighting the utility of molecular descriptors in understanding TCA cycle activation.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-35">摘要</h3>
<p>The wet-dry tropics of much of northern Australia, from Cape York to the Kimberley, contain some of the most pristine tropical estuaries globally. These estuaries have been under-researched, but provide a unique opportunity to understand the functioning of estuaries prior to intensive human impacts. The region is also under pressure from land-based development and climate change. Therefore we review, for the first time, the current knowledge of the ecology of these estuaries, then examine the potential effect of these stressors on the health and functioning of these estuaries. Flow alteration to provide water for irrigated agriculture is the development activity most likely to have a significant impact on estuaries in this region in the short- to medium-term. This flow alteration will reduce sediment and nutrient loads downstream, and reduce the scale of wet season flooding into saltmarshes and mangroves adjacent to estuaries. Faunal growth and reproduction in these systems is strongly cued to flow events and therefore are likely to be affected by flow alteration. Climate change impacts, such as extended droughts, will exacerbate the reduced flow from water development. Sea level rise and increased evapotranspiration are likely to have major impacts on the ecological functioning and habitat structure of estuaries. Our review demonstrates that our knowledge of the ecology of many of these estuaries remains limited, and therefore we identify key knowledge gaps related to the physical, chemical and biological attributes of estuaries which impede our ability to accurately predict future impacts of land-based development and climate change.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-36">摘要</h3>
<p>Coral reef ecosystems are increasingly threatened by environmental stressors, with microplastics (MPs) emerging as a pervasive and harmful contaminant. As essential symbionts of reef-building corals, Symbiodiniaceae are vital to coral health; however, their physiological responses to MPs remain largely unexplored. This study investigates the toxic effects of polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) of five distinct colors (red, yellow, green, blue, and white) on Cladocopium goreaui, a dominant coral symbiont. Exposure to 5 μm PS-MPs at 20 mg/L significantly inhibited algal growth, with blue and white PS-MPs exhibiting the strongest suppression. Growth rates decreased by up to approximately 36.0 % compared to controls over a 20-day exposure period. Although C. goreaui upregulated photosynthetic pigment content to compensate for reduced light availability due to MP aggregation, a substantial portion of the generated energy was diverted to mitigate oxidative stress. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that PS-MPs exposure downregulated key genes involved in biosynthetic pathways (e.g., peptide/amide formation) and primary metabolism (e.g., nitrogen assimilation, lipid metabolism). The pronounced toxicity of blue and white PS-MPs was attributed to their strong suppression of fatty acid metabolism and ribosomal function. These findings highlight the role of color disparity in modulating MP toxicity and offer new insight into the physiological and molecular responses of coral symbionts to MP pollution, with implications for coral reef health and resilience.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-37">摘要</h3>
<p>The hippocampus and amygdala are important limbic structures involved in memory, emotional regulation, and stress response, which are pivotal for social interactions, everyday functioning, and participation in community life. However, the presumably bidirectional relationship between limbic structure and psychosocial functioning-and the potential moderating role of early-life environmental risk factors-remains poorly understood in schizophrenia spectrum (SSD) and mood disorders (MOD).
Structural 3 T MRI data were collected from SSD (n = 64) and MOD (n = 66) patients as well as healthy controls (HC, n = 46). Hippocampal subfields and amygdala nuclei were segmented using FreeSurfer v7.3.2. Psychosocial functioning was assessed with the Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP). Childhood maltreatment, urban upbringing, and migration background were examined as potential moderators.
SSD patients showed significant volume reductions in left hippocampal subfields compared to HC (FDR-corrected p &lt; .05). Within SSD, PSP scores were associated with volumes of the left hippocampal body, tail, and molecular layer (FDR-corrected p &lt; .05), with emotional abuse and neglect significantly moderating these associations. No other environmental risk factors showed significant interaction effects. In MOD, only the left fimbria differed from HC (FDR-corrected p &lt; .05), but this was unrelated to PSP scores, and no significant interactions were found.
Our findings indicate that early-life emotional adversity moderates the relationship between psychosocial functioning and hippocampal structure in SSD, but not in MOD, highlighting the need to consider emotional trauma histories when investigating functional outcomes in SSD patients.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-38">摘要</h3>
<p>Reproductive health concerns related to environmental pollutants have gained significant attention, yet the link between blood exposure levels and male reproductive health is still not well understood. This study assessed plasma levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pesticides, and metals/metalloids in reproductive-age men from Jinhua, China, and explored exposure-related factors and their associations with semen quality. The results showed that five PAHs (acenaphthene, fluorene, phenanthrene, fluoranthene, and pyrene) and two pesticides (p,p’-DDE and bifenthrin) were detected in plasma samples, with detection frequencies for individual compounds ranging from 21.2 % to 66.9 %. The mean exposure levels for PAHs and pesticides ranged from 31.91 to 277.97 ng/g lipids. For metals/metalloids, plasma concentrations ranged from 0.38 to 1539.03 ng/mL, with Hg at the lowest and Zn at the highest. These results revealed generally low to moderate levels of PAHs, p,p’-DDE, Hg, As, Se, Zn, Mn, Fe, and Cr, but elevated levels of Pb, Cd, Al, Ba, and Ni, indicating potential localized pollution concerns. Demographic and lifestyle factors significantly influenced pollutant exposure. Older individuals had higher levels of PAHs, Hg, and As, while fish consumption was linked to higher Hg and Se levels, and tea and fruit intake to higher pesticide exposure. Men with higher BMI exhibited elevated Hg levels, and stress influenced the concentrations of Fe, Zn and Ni. More importantly, significant associations were identified between pollutant exposure and semen quality, with elevated PAHs and Cr levels linked to reduced sperm concentration, and PAHs, Cr, and DDE levels negatively correlated with sperm viability. This study provides new insights into the relationship between plasma pollutant exposure and male reproductive health, and emphasize the need for targeted health interventions.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-39">摘要</h3>
<p>In recent years, healthcare environments have witnessed an increase in incidents of violence, often attributed to dissatisfaction with the quality of services provided or with the manner in which care is delivered during healthcare assistance. In the quest to find a theoretical basis for this observation, a systematic review was conducted over the past 5 years, and the literature indicates that this phenomenon is particularly pronounced in the aggression directed towards nurses and physicians. Regardless of geographical location, there is a higher prevalence of violent incidents in environments where interaction and collaboration between patients and healthcare professionals are essential. These aggressive and violent behaviors encompass a variety of deliberate actions that are often misconstrued and perceived as entitlements by patients in a state of illness. Although physical violence is conspicuous due to the visible marks it leaves, psychological aggression is the most commonly reported form of violence by nurses and doctors. Unfortunately, verbal violence often goes unnoticed and is inadequately quantified. Continuous exposure to violence poses a significant threat and risk factor to all healthcare professionals, making it essential to address and mitigate this issue to ensure a safe and healthy working environment for all involved in healthcare delivery.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-40">摘要</h3>
<p>Lead is the primary environmental risk factor for cognitive impairment. However, the lead exposure-related cognitive burden across the life cycle remains unclear. We estimate the burden of idiopathic developmental intellectual disability (IDID) attributable to lead exposure at global, regional, and national levels for all age groups from birth onward, with a focus on children and older adults.
The age-specific disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and age-standardized DALYs rate (ASDR) were examined using the Global Burden of Disease 2021. Average annual percentage change was applied to assess ASDR temporal trends. Correlation analyses, health inequality analyses, and frontier analyses were used to estimate the impact of socio-demographic index (SDI) on DALYs. The Bayesian age-period-cohort model combined with Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations framework was applied to predict IDID changes.
In 2021, there were 2.38 million DALYs of IDID attributable to lead exposure across the entire life cycle. The highest number of DALYs (0.77 million) and ASDR (38.20/100,000) were found in children aged 0-14 years, but these have declined since 1990, especially among males in high SDI region. However, the number of DALYs and ASDR among adults aged ≥ 70 years increased sharply, which increased from 4836.52 (95 % uncertainty interval [UI], 1622.03-9348.03) and 2.35 (95 % UI, 0.80-4.54) per 100,000 in 1990-78297.55 (95 % UI, 2708.52-189584.79) and 9.79 (95 % UI, 0.34-23.74) per 100,000 in 2035, respectively. This trend was most pronounced among females in low SDI region. Global inequalities in DALYs of IDID attributable to lead exposure among adults aged ≥ 70 years are widening.
The lead exposure-related IDID burden has declined among children since 1990, demonstrating substantial global progress in childhood lead governance. However, the burden has increased substantially among those aged ≥ 70 years as aging intensifies, with particular concern for elderly females in low SDI region.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-41">摘要</h3>
<p>This study aimed to characterize cardiovascular risk profiles in an obstetric population using American Heart Association’s Life’s Essential 8 components and investigate which combinations are associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP).
Secondary analysis of a prospective observational cohort, Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-be (nuMoM2b).
We used latent class analysis to identify cardiovascular risk classes using Life’s Essential 8 indicators at 6-14 weeks’ gestation: blood pressure (BP), body mass index (BMI), and self-reported diet, sleep, smoke exposure, and physical activity. We assessed predictors of class membership and odds of HDP with logistic regression.
We identified a four-class solution with the following interpretative labels: (1) Healthy Behaviors/Normal BMI &amp; BP (42%), (2) No Physical Activity/Normal BMI &amp; BP (31%), (3) High Snoring/Elevated BMI (18%), and (4) Poor Behaviors/Normal BMI &amp; BP (8%). Compared with the Healthy Behaviors/Normal BMI &amp; BP class, individuals in the other risk profiles were more likely to be unmarried vs. married, Non-Hispanic Black vs. Non-Hispanic White, have government vs. commercial insurance, and report high vs. low periconceptual stress. Two risk profiles were associated with HDP: High Snoring/Elevated BMI had 2.4 times (95% CI 2.1-2.8) the odds and Poor Behaviors/Normal BMI &amp; BP had 1.5 times (95% CI 1.2-1.8) the odds of HDP compared with Healthy Behaviors/Normal BMI &amp; BP.
Two cardiovascular risk profiles-High Snoring/Elevated BMI and Poor Behaviors/Normal BMI &amp; BP-were linked to HDP, emphasizing the potential for personalized, multifactorial interventions targeting modifiable behaviors to reduce risk.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-42">摘要</h3>
<p>The Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety (KINS) has designated Rice and Napa cabbage, which account for a large proportion of the Korean diet, as staple foods for continuous radioactivity monitoring. Assessing internal exposure from food ingestion is essential for public health and radiation safety. This study evaluated the radioactivity concentrations of these foods and quantified annual effective doses from their ingestion. Samples of Rice and Napa cabbage collected from 15 regions nationwide from 2014 to 2023 by Regional Radioactivity Monitoring Stations (RRMSs) were analyzed for K-40 and Cs-137. Soil types were classified using the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) soil texture triangle, and regional variations in food radioactivity concentrations were assessed relative to soil texture. Based on these data and intake statistics from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the annual effective dose from K-40 ingestion was calculated using the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) dose conversion factor of 0.062 μSv/Bq. K-40 concentrations ranged from 1.65 to 75.6 Bq kg-1-fresh in Rice and 10.4-122 Bq kg-1-fresh in Napa cabbage, with cabbage averaging about three times higher. The estimated annual effective doses were 7.53 μSv for Rice and 10.1 μSv for cabbage, corresponding to ∼0.7 % of natural background exposure (2400 μSv y-1) and ∼5.8 % of the dose from total food ingestion (290 μSv y-1). These results demonstrate that the radiological impact of staple food consumption in South Korea is negligible and provide a scientific basis for food-based environmental radioactivity monitoring and radiological emergency preparedness.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-43">摘要</h3>
<p>This study investigated the association between cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome stages 0-3 and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and heart failure (HF), as well as whether this association varies by interleukin-6 and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP).
6579 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) were included. Restricted mean survival time (RMST) differences in ASCVD and HF-free survival by CKM syndrome stage, stratified by inflammatory markers, were estimated.
Over a median follow-up of 17.5 years (IQR: 10.5-18.4 years), participants with CKM stage 3 demonstrated significantly shorter ASCVD-free survival compared to stage 0 (-1.94 years; 95 % CI: -2.27, -1.61). Subgroup analysis by IL-6 levels demonstrated differential RMST across CKM stages, with participants having above-median IL-6 levels showing greater survival reduction (-2.5 years; 95 % CI: -3.50, -1.85) than those with below-median levels (-1.46 years; 95 % CI: -1.84, -1.07) (interaction p = 0.002). For heart failure outcomes, categorization by IL-6 levels displayed similar patterns by CKM stage (interaction p = 0.006). Among participants with elevated IL-6, both CKM stages 2 and 3 were associated with reduced HF-free survival (-0.40 years [95 % CI: -0.69, -0.01], and -0.87 years [95 % CI: -1.18, -0.55], respectively). Conversely, participants with lower IL-6 levels showed a significant reduction in HF-free survival only at the CKM stage 3 level (-0.36 years: 95 % CI: -0.57, -0.14). hsCRP stratification yielded comparable results but without significant interactions for either cardiovascular outcome.
These findings suggest that systemic inflammation, as measured by IL-6, may modify the risk of ASCVD and HF associated with CKM syndrome. Therefore, IL-6 measurement could potentially refine risk stratification and prognosis of CKM syndrome stages. However, further studies are needed to assess the clinical relevance of this approach.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-44">摘要</h3>
<p>This study aimed to examine the associations between adolescent characteristics and sleep habits in Hong Kong.
A cross-sectional study was conducted among secondary school students in Hong Kong. Data on sociodemographics, health behaviors, mental toughness, and sleep patterns were collected. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with late bedtime, insufficient sleep duration, and late wake-up time.
Among 1345 adolescents surveyed, 60.1% reported late bedtime, 56.6% experienced insufficient sleep duration (&lt;8 h), and 34.1% reported late wake-up time. In multivariable models, older age was consistently associated with adverse sleep habits (aORlate wake-up = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.23-2.18, p = 0.001; aORlate bedtime = 2.69, 95% CI: 1.98-3.64, p &lt; 0.001; aORinsufficient duration = 1.74, 95% CI: 1.31-2.31, p &lt; 0.001). Exceeding recommended screen time was linked to later bedtimes (aORvideo = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.14-1.88, p = 0.003; aORgame = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.10-1.84, p = 0.007; aORsocial media = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.38-2.29, p &lt; 0.001) and insufficient sleep duration (aORsocial media = 1.87, 95% CI: 1.46-2.39, p &lt; 0.001). Daily breakfast consumption was consistently associated with lower odds of late bedtime (aOR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.39-0.63, p &lt; 0.001), insufficient sleep duration (aOR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.44-0.71, p &lt; 0.001), and late wake-up time (aOR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.54-0.88, p = 0.002). Alcohol consumption was associated with higher odds of insufficient sleep duration (aOR = 1.80, 95% CI: 1.10-2.96, p = 0.020) and lower odds of late wake-up (aOR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.37-0.96, p = 0.032). Male students had lower odds of insufficient sleep (aOR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.54-0.87, p = 0.002) but higher odds of waking up late (aOR = 1.75, 95% CI: 1.37-2.24, p &lt; 0.001).
This study identified high rates of adverse sleep habits among Hong Kong adolescents and demonstrated strong associations with age, screen use, dietary behavior, and other lifestyle factors. These findings highlight the need for targeted interventions-such as digital use guidelines and school-based breakfast programs-to promote healthy sleep patterns during adolescence.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-45">摘要</h3>
<p>Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) using targeted panel next-generation sequencing (TP-NGS) is pivotal in the clinical management of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC). Despite the limitations associated with tumor tissue sampling, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) presents a promising alternative. This study aims to assess the prognostic value of ctDNA tumor fraction (TF) in aNSCLC.
We conducted a multicenter prospective study in Hong Kong. Patients with aNSCLC provided blood samples within 31 days before treatment initiation, followed by CGP using a validated ctDNA assay.
Among 878 patients, those with ctDNA TF ≥1% had significantly worse outcomes, with median progression-free survival (PFS) of 13.2 months and overall survival (OS) of 17.6 months compared with the ctDNA TF &lt;1% group (P &lt; .05). ctDNA TF demonstrated predictive capabilities for OS at various time points, with AUC values ranging from 0.65 to 0.75 for the overall population. The predictive strength of ctDNA TF in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) subgroup remained robust for OS at 24 months, achieving an AUC of 0.79. We validated a ctDNA TF threshold of 2.3% for inferior OS in the overall population, whereas a distinct threshold of 1.6% and 2.2% was validated for EGFR TKI and chemotherapy ± immunotherapy.
Our findings establish ctDNA TF as a clinically relevant biomarker in aNSCLC, providing robust prognostic and predictive information. The findings support the integration of ctDNA TF quantification into routine clinical workflows, reinforcing its role in advancing precision oncology and improving risk stratification and outcomes for patients with aNSCLC.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-46">摘要</h3>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed a significant economic burden globally, particularly in regions with stringent response measures. This study aims to assess the economic impact of COVID-19 in Taiwan, focusing on both direct and indirect costs. A cost-of-illness analysis was conducted, utilizing data from the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC), national databases, epidemiological studies, and economic surveys. The analysis included both direct costs (e.g., hospital admissions, outpatient care) and indirect costs (e.g., productivity losses due to long COVID, absenteeism, caregiving duties). The study encompassed Taiwan’s population of 23.2 million, with particular attention to age-specific impacts on economic outcomes. The total economic burden of COVID-19 in Taiwan was estimated at USD 4431 million. Direct costs accounted for 24.40% (USD 1081 million), while indirect costs constituted 75.60% (USD 3350 million). The working age population bore the majority of this burden, with 88.68% (USD 3090 million) of total costs attributed to this group. Long COVID significantly contributed to the economic impact, causing a 35% reduction in productivity. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the frequency of outpatient visits among working age and elderly cohorts was a critical factor influencing overall costs. The study underscores the substantial economic burden of stringent COVID-19 policies in Taiwan, highlighting that indirect costs were nearly three times higher than direct costs. The findings emphasize the need for resilient healthcare systems and support for affected workers, particularly in regions with similar response strategies. The methodological approach offers insights that could be applied to other regions facing similar challenges.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-47">摘要</h3>
<p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by various pathological lesions and an imbalance in the microflora. The Yi-Qi-Xuan-Fei Formula (YQXF) is a clinically effective formula with pharmacological potential to delay the progression of COPD. This study aims to explore the relationship between the therapeutic mechanism of YQXF and the microflora in COPD. Our study found that YQXF reduces inflammatory injury and inflammatory cell infiltration in lung tissue, repairs the intestinal mucosal barrier, and enhances immune function. Additionally, YQXF regulates the pulmonary and intestinal flora by increasing the abundance of Alloprevotella, Roseburia, Oscillibacter, and Lactobacillus, while reducing the abundance of Fusobacterium, Escherichia/Shigella, and Clostridium sensu stricto. Moreover, YQXF elevates the levels of short-chain fatty acids, which are produced by the intestinal flora. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that YQXF reduces inflammation levels in lung tissue and repairs the intestinal barrier in COPD rats. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory and tissue damage prevention effects of YQXF are based on its intervention in the pulmonary and intestinal flora. These findings provide valuable insights into the fundamental mechanism of the herbal formula YQXF and suggest that specifically targeting the intestinal flora could be a potential therapeutic approach for COPD.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-48">摘要</h3>
<p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death globally and discovering novel therapeutic agents to treat the disease, and prevent cancer metastasis and recurrence is an urgent medical need. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) capable of self-renewal and differentiation are generally considered the cause of tumor metastasis, recurrence and chemoresistance. Hence, targeting CSCs may be a promising strategy for the treatment of cancer. GATA6, a zinc finger transcription factor, contributes to tumorigenesis in CRC and is related to cancer stemness. GATA6-overexpressing stable clones OE4 and OE6 derived from HCT116 cells were previously established and exhibited increased stemness properties. In this study, we found that OE4 and OE6 cells displayed CSC-like properties, including higher expression levels of stemness-related proteins, increased sphere forming capacity and resistance to 5-fluorouracil. OE4 and OE6 cells also showed increased glucose uptake capacity, another hallmark of CSCs. Therefore, these two cell clones were employed as a CSC-like cell model to search for potential colorectal CSC-targeting drugs. Among several compounds tested, dihydroartemisinin (DHA), an antimalarial drug, exerted better anticancer activity toward OE4 and OE6 relative to the empty vector-transfected HCT116 cells. DHA also inhibited sphere formation and impaired glucose metabolism. DHA induced G0/G1 arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, DHA also induced reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial membrane potential loss. Thus, DHA caused mitochondrial damage which was confirmed by Seahorse mitochondrial stress test. DHA also increased LC3B-II and PINK1 protein levels, indicative of autophagy/mitophagy. In conclusion, repurposing DHA may be a potential strategy against colorectal CSCs and further validation using in vivo models is warranted.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-49">摘要</h3>
<p>SLC6A1-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder (SLC6A1-NDD) is one of the most common monogenic disorders reported in genetic databases. There is no established quality-of-life (QoL) measure that captures the impact of SLC6A1-NDD on patients and caregivers. This study investigates how clinical characteristics of SLC6A1-NDD correlate with QoL scores obtained during our study.
We conducted univariable comparisons (n = 52) of the Quality-of-Life Inventory-Disability, Quality-of-Life of Childhood Epilepsy (QOLCE-55, ages 5-18-years), and Pediatric Quality-of-Life Inventory Family Impact Module with 45 clinical characteristics of SLC6A1-NDD. Given the non-normal score distributions of our sample, Spearman’s rank order correlation coefficient and Wilcoxon rank-sum test were utilized.
Lower QOLCE-55 total scores were associated with regression, absence seizures, clinical severity, coordination difficulties, and male gender (P &lt; 0.039). Autism severity was significantly associated with lower total scores on all three QoL measures (P &lt; 0.025; ρ = -0.473 to -0.681). Longitudinal Pediatric Quality-of-Life Inventory Family Impact Module scores suggest family relationships can improve over time.
Of the three measures utilized, QOLCE-55 had the largest representation of statistically significant clinical features driving subdomain and total scores. Autism severity was a driver of lower QoL in all measures. While this suggests the utility of QOLCE-55 in patients with SLC6A1-NDD, subdomain scores of all three measures captured clinical features that were not represented in total scores. Future studies should utilize these measures in larger cohorts of patients to further explore these findings.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-50">摘要</h3>
<p>Micronutrient deficiencies are common in institutionalised older adults due to chronic diseases, functional decline and age-related changes, increasing their risk of poor health outcomes. The study aim was to assess the usual daily intakes and status of selected micronutrients in nursing home (NH) residents, and to examine the relationship between dietary supplementation, micronutrient status and health characteristics. Additionally, we aimed to identify factors associated with serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25(OH)D) and haemoglobin levels. The Nutricare study included 387 NH residents with low to moderate care needs from 20 NH. Collected data included resident characteristics, usual dietary intake (two 24-hour recalls, food frequency questionnaire), blood/serum biomarkers (25(OH)D, folate, vitamin B12, haemoglobin, ferritin), hand grip strength and body composition, estimated by bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy. Over 90% of study participants had inadequate intakes of vitamin D, magnesium and potassium. Despite 63% of participants reported use of supplements, suboptimal micronutrient status was common, with those aged 80+ and with higher care needs being more at risk. Most of participants who did not supplement vitamin D had insufficient 25(OH)D levels-both during winter (98%) and summer (71%). Low haemoglobin (&lt;130 g/L) was found in 43% and ferritin &lt;30 μg/L in 9%. These findings highlight the need for optimised NH menus and personalised supplementation strategies. Year-round vitamin D supplementation is essential, as diet and sun exposure are insufficient. Priority should be given to prevention over treatment, supported by clear guidelines for micronutrient management in this vulnerable population.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-51">摘要</h3>
<p>Engagement in cognitive leisure activities (CLA) may reduce the risk of dementia, but findings are often challenged by reverse causation and unmeasured cognitive reserve.
To examine the association between CLA and incident dementia whilst accounting for reverse causation and lifelong cognitive enrichment.
Prospective cohort study with a 12-year follow-up, including a 7-year exposure-outcome time lag.
Community-dwelling older adults from the three-city study conducted in France.
A total of 3326 participants aged 65 and older, free of dementia at baseline and during the time-lag period.
At baseline, participants reported frequency of engagement in five cognitively stimulating activities. A global CLA score was calculated and categorised into low, moderate, and high engagement. Incident dementia and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) were ascertained during the 5-year follow-up. Delayed-entry Cox models with age as the time scale were used, adjusting for socio-demographic, health-related, and genetic factors including APOE ε4 and past occupational grade.
Compared to low CLA engagement, moderate and high engagement were associated with lower risk of dementia (hazard ratios [HR] = 0.50 [95% CI: 0.33-0.76] and 0.53 [0.35-0.80]) and AD (HR = 0.35 [0.20-0.59] and 0.45 [0.28-0.73]). Frequent engagement in crosswords and artistic activities showed the strongest independent associations with reduced dementia risk.
CLA in late life is associated with lower dementia risk, beyond the influence of cognitive reserve and reverse causation. Promoting such activities may be a valuable component of dementia prevention strategies in older adults.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-52">摘要</h3>
<p>Disclosure of HIV status is critical for HIV prevention and control. However, although the benefits of HIV disclosure have received extensive documentation, the same cannot be said for its drawbacks. In the current study, we used a descriptive qualitative study design to highlight the implications of disclosure among 30 pregnant and postpartum women living with HIV in Uganda. We conducted a qualitative content analysis and found that healthcare professionals responded positively and supportively when HIV-positive pregnant and postpartum women disclosed their status, and that individuals who disclosed their status to their husbands but not to wider circles also experienced no mistreatment or discrimination. Contrarily, however, some husbands reacted unfavourably to their wife’s HIV-positive status when a larger audience was involved in the disclosure. In particular, we discovered that co-wives and in-laws promoted stigmatization, including violence, by husbands. The interaction between these HIV-positive women and their mothers also demonstrated both positive and negative implications. This counterintuitive attitude has the consequence of reducing the uptake of antiretroviral drugs. There is therefore a need for policies and initiatives that not only encourage disclosure to health professionals, spouses and a few close relatives or friends but prevent stigmatization, violence and other forms of abuse against HIV-positive women.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-53">摘要</h3>
<p>Addressing the challenge of employing a comprehensive risk analysis approach that effectively captures and quantifies all contributing factors remains a significant endeavor in both academic research and practical field applications. This study endeavors to fill this gap by introducing a practical safety risk assessment approach, named the FMEA+ method, grounded in the conventional Failure Modes and Effects Analysis. To construct a comprehensive taxonomy that encompasses the contributing factors within each dimension of risk, a three-stage Delphi study engaged 35 Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). The Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) was employed to acquire knowledge and assign weights to the factors and sub-factors. The validation and reliability assessment of the developed taxonomy included evaluating the Content Validity Ratio (CVR), Content Validity Index (CVI), and Cronbach’s alpha coefficient, yielding values of 0.77, 0.91, and 0.86, respectively. Independent peer reviews and reality checks further substantiated the credibility of the proposed taxonomy. The introduced safety risk assessment algorithm, FMEA + , derived from the FMEA technique, comprises three main factors and 12 sub-factors. The final normalized weights for the three factors-occurrence, severity, and detectability-were determined to be 0.337, 0.348, and 0.315, respectively. In the three factors of occurrence, severity, and detection, the most important sub-factors identified were human reliability, human injury, and technical inspection, respectively. This proposed taxonomy serves as a foundational tool for facilitating informed decision-making and the effective implementation of risk mitigation strategies. The application of this innovative approach offers a scientific alternative to traditional FMEA methods within similar industries, addressing existing challenges in a more comprehensive and nuanced manner.</p>
