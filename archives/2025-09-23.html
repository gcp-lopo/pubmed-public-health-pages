<h2 id="article-1">1. Intrinsic Capacity Defined Using 4 Domains, Genetic Risk, and Incident Parkinson Disease: A Prospective Cohort Study.</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: Neurology
<strong>发表日期</strong>: 2025-Oct-21
<strong>链接</strong>: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40982772">PubMed</a></p>

<h3 id="摘要">摘要</h3>
<p>Intrinsic capacity (IC), a World Health Organization-defined measure of healthy aging, has been linked to several neurologic disorders but has not been extrapolated to Parkinson disease (PD). The study aimed to explore the association between IC and incident PD and whether genetic risk modulated this association.
This longitudinal analysis used data from the UK Biobank, a prospective cohort study designed to investigate the impact of genetic and environmental factors on health outcomes. Participants were voluntarily recruited from 22 assessment centers across the United Kingdom between 2006 and 2010. Individuals with IC component data and without pre-existing PD or dementia at baseline were included. The IC deficit score was derived from 4 domains: psychological (exhaustion and sleep duration), sensory (visual and hearing impairments), vitality (grip strength and weight loss), and locomotor function (walking speed), while the cognitive domain was not assessed. Genetic risk was estimated by polygenic risk score, and incident PD was identified using an algorithm. Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs.
Of the 401,791 participants (mean age [SD], 56.6 [8.0] years; 53.8% female) included, 2,763 (0.69%) developed PD during a median follow-up of 12.3 years. The HR (95% CI) for incident PD was 1.82 (1.50-2.20) in individuals with IC deficit scores of 4+ compared with those with 0. Each 1-point increment in IC deficit was associated with a 16% (95% CI 12%-20%) increased risk of PD. Low IC was associated with a 68% (95% CI 48%-91%) higher risk of incident PD. Individuals with low IC and high genetic risk were at the highest PD risk (HR = 3.01; 95% CI 2.40-3.78). High genetic risk attenuated the protective role of high IC (HR [95% CI]: 0.45 [0.35-0.58] in low risk vs 0.72 [0.59-0.88] in high risk; P for interaction = 0.002), but high IC was still associated with a diminished risk of PD in the high-risk group.
High IC was associated with a decreased risk of PD, even in genetically high-risk individuals. The absence of the cognitive domain may limit understanding of the association.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-2">摘要</h3>
<p>Clostridioides difficile remains a leading cause of hospital-acquired infections, with its primary virulence factor, toxin B (TcdB), responsible for severe colitis and recurrent disease. The closely related toxin, TcsL, from Paeniclostridium sordellii, causes a rarer but often fatal toxic shock syndrome, particularly in gynecological and obstetric contexts. We report the de novo design of small protein minibinders that directly neutralize TcdB and TcsL by preventing their entry into host cells. Using deep learning and Rosetta-based approaches, we generated high-affinity minibinders that protect cells from intoxication with picomolar potency and, in the case of TcsL, prolonged survival following lethal toxin challenge in mice. The designed proteins against TcdB demonstrate exceptional stability in proteolytic and acidic environments, making them well-suited for oral delivery-a valuable feature for treating C. difficile infections localized to the gastrointestinal tract. For TcsL, potent inhibitors were identified from 48 initial designs and 48 optimized designs, highlighting the potential of computational design for rapidly developing countermeasures against life-threatening bacterial toxins.</p>

<h2 id="article-4">4. Dried fish provide widespread access to critical nutrients across Africa.</h2>

<h3 id="摘要-3">摘要</h3>
<p>Aquatic foods are essential in supporting food security and nutrition across the tropics, with “dried” fish particularly affordable, available, and nutritious. However, dried fish food systems are often hidden and overlooked due to data scarcity, limiting understanding of how dried fish contribute to nutrient intakes. Here, we combine nutrient analysis of fish samples with national household surveys from across East and West Africa to understand the importance of dried fish in diets. We find that small portions of dried fish contribute over 15% of recommended intakes for multiple essential dietary nutrients (calcium, iodine, iron, selenium, zinc, and vitamins B12 and D), with low heavy metal concentrations, and are consumed weekly by ~one-third of households in six countries (Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda) (~144 million people). Dried fish consumption was more prevalent than fresh fish, reaching 54% more people, particularly those in poor households and near to marine coastlines or urban centers. The widespread prevalence of nutritious dried fish suggests that these foods and their distribution networks play critical roles in food security and nutrition, even in households distant from fisheries or urban centers. Dried fish can fill nutrient gaps across the tropics but will require policies that mitigate negative effects of overfishing, environmental changes, and competition with international markets, while providing postharvest support to fish processors.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-4">摘要</h3>
<p>Home-based palliative care relies on empowered family caregivers to overcome the limited availability of palliative care professional resources in managing incurable cancer.
To explore whether adding a palliative care educational app to clinical palliative care could enhance health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in homebound patients with incurable cancer.
Single-center, open-label, individual randomized trial. (Chinese Clinical Trial Registry: ChiCTR2300077346).
Single site in Shanghai, China.
Patients with incurable cancer (aged ≥18 years; Karnofsky Performance Status ≤70) receiving palliative care along with consistent family caregivers (aged ≥18 years) enrolled between 28 July and 3 November 2023.
Patient-caregiver pairs were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the intervention group (the app plus palliative care as usual [app]) or the control group (palliative care as usual). The app provided multimedia education on symptom and adverse effect management and nursing information for family caregivers.
The primary outcome was the mean between-group difference at month 2 in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) score, with the summary score ranging from 0 to 100 and higher scores indicating better outcomes. The primary analysis used the intention-to-treat approach.
Of 154 randomly assigned pairs, 147 completed baseline assessments (intervention: n = 74; control: n = 73). The mean age of patients was 59.9 years, and 42.9% were female. At month 2, EORTC QLQ-C30 summary scores were 51.9 (95% CI, 45.4 to 58.5) in the intervention group and 35.7 (CI, 28.6 to 42.9) in the control group, with a mean difference of 16.2 (CI, 9.3 to 23.1).
Single-center design in China, Chinese-only WeChat app platform, unknown education levels of caregivers and patients, open-label design, and short 2-month follow-up with self-reported outcomes.
The palliative care educational app through WeChat improved HRQoL among patients with incurable cancer at 2 months. This finding has implications for future study and development.

<h3 id="摘要-5">摘要</h3>
<p>There have been multiple changes to the Arms Act 1983 in Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ) which have subsequently been associated with reductions in firearm-related suicide. In response to the worst mass shooting in NZ’s history, stricter regulations on firearm ownership were introduced in 2020.
To describe both individual- and population-level risks for firearm-related offenses, hospitalizations, and deaths in NZ and to summarize the annual costs (in U.S. dollars).
Retrospective cohort study.
New Zealand.
All NZ residents (individual-level data, 2000 to 2018; population-level data, 2000 to mid-2024).
Rates per million people for firearm-related hospitalizations and deaths secondary to assault, accidents, and suicide were examined. Years of life lost (YLLs) and age-adjusted rates were calculated as well as rate ratios (RRs) for hospitalization or death with 95% CIs.
Firearm-related hospitalizations and deaths due to self-harm or accidents decreased between 2000 and 2018, but rates due to assault increased 2.5-fold between 2014 and 2018. Hospitalizations due to accidents were higher for children aged 0 to 14 years than for persons aged 15 years or older (RR, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.97 to 1.27]). Māori (RR, 2.88 [CI, 2.30 to 3.61]) and Pacific Peoples (RR, 2.14 [CI, 1.57 to 2.92]) had higher rates of hospitalization due to assault than persons in the European/Other group. The average cost of firearm-related hospitalizations was $871 000 per year, and YLLs yielded a total mortality cost of $189 million per year.
The results include only firearm-related injuries and deaths resulting in hospitalization and do not include firearm-related injuries that did not result in hospitalization or other burdens of illness related to firearms.
The high costs of firearm-related injuries underscore the importance of improving firearm-related harm reduction in NZ. This will depend on maintaining and strengthening current firearm access restrictions and could be enhanced through firearm education.

<h3 id="摘要-6">摘要</h3>
<p>After private equity acquisition, hospitals may experience changes in staffing with implications for patients.
To examine hospital staffing and patient outcomes in emergency departments (EDs) and intensive care units (ICUs) before and after hospitals were acquired by private equity.
Matched difference-in-differences analysis.
100% Medicare Part A and B claims and Cost Report data from 2009 to 2019.
1 007 529 ED visits and 121 080 ICU hospitalizations across 49 private equity hospitals were compared with 6 179 854 ED visits and 760 377 ICU hospitalizations across 293 matched control hospitals.
Hospital ED and ICU salary expenditures, patient mortality, length of stay, and transfers. Secondary outcomes included hospital-wide salary expenditures and full-time employees.
After acquisition, private equity hospitals reduced ED salary expenditures by 18.2% (-$12.63 per inpatient bed day; 95% CI, -$22.74 to -$2.52; P = 0.015) and ICU salary expenditures by 15.9% (-$8.46 per inpatient bed day, CI, -$13.21 to -$3.72; P &lt; 0.001) relative to control. This occurred alongside average hospital-wide reductions in full-time employees by 11.6% and salary expenditures by 16.6%, relative to control. Beneficiaries in EDs of private equity hospitals experienced 7.0 additional deaths per 10 000 visits after acquisition relative to control (13.4% increase from a raw baseline of 52.4 deaths per 10 000; P = 0.009). No differential change in ICU mortality was observed. However, patients in private equity EDs and ICUs experienced a 4.2% and 10.6% increase in transfers, respectively, to other acute care hospitals after acquisition relative to control. On average, ICU length of stay shortened by 0.2 days. Sensitivity analyses produced qualitatively similar findings.
Potential unmeasured confounding; lack of generalizability to other acquisitions or patient populations.
After private equity acquisition, hospitals on average reduced salaries and staffing relative to nonacquired hospitals, notably in the EDs and ICUs, which are higher-acuity and staffing-sensitive areas. This decreased capacity to deliver care may explain the increased patient transfers to other hospitals, shortened ICU lengths of stay, and increased ED mortality.

<h3 id="摘要-9">摘要</h3>
<p>Dynamic Movement Intervention (DMI) and Cuevas Medek Exercises (CME) are promoted as innovative neurorehabilitation methods for children with neurological disabilities, yet both rely on outdated reflex-hierarchical models rather than contemporary motor learning principles. A review of the literature reveals that CME, despite 5 decades of use, is supported only by a few case reports and 2 small, biased comparative studies. DMI, introduced in 2021, has no published empirical evidence beyond a single conference abstract. Thus, both interventions remain at Sackett Level 5-no evidence. The ethical implications are substantial. Families often pay thousands for intensive, noncovered therapies that may displace meaningful participation in education and social life. Therapists have a professional responsibility to avoid legitimizing unproven practices and to prioritize interventions supported by robust evidence. Pediatric rehabilitation should shift toward child-led, functional, and task-specific approaches grounded in modern motor learning science, with professional bodies and insurers withholding endorsement of nonevidence-based methods.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-10">摘要</h3>
<p>Digital platforms and smartphone apps have the potential to help patients with musculoskeletal conditions receive targeted interventions and physiotherapy support at home. As musculoskeletal conditions are much more prevalent in older adults, it is important to determine whether these technologies are accessible and acceptable to this demographic, who may possess lower levels of digital literacy compared to younger adults.
The study aims to evaluate the feasibility and usability of completing functional assessments while recording the activity using smartphone inertial sensors in adults 60 years or older.
Participants (N=21) were recruited from a range of community settings to complete a 4-week home-based trial, recording unsupervised sit-to-stand and single-leg balance activities at least once per week using their smartphone. We analyzed the data quality and adherence by number of assessments per week from the uploaded datasets. Feedback on usability was assessed using interviews and the System Usability Score.
Inductive content analysis was used to identify 5 top-level categories: app, device, task, time, and personal perception. The mean System Usability Scale score was 81.2 (SD 17.5). The proportion of valid data uploads was 63.8% (81/127) for single-leg balance and 93.5% (58/62) for sit-to-stand measures. Adherence was high, with no significant deviations in the mean number of sessions completed or duration between sessions.
Smartphone-based monitoring of functional activities can facilitate unsupervised, remote assessments, thus reducing burden on physiotherapy services and increasing the ability to monitor progress objectively. Activities should be considered for complexity and, where necessary, increase in difficulty over time. App-based feedback is essential to inform users of the progress and adherence to the activities.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-11">摘要</h3>
<p>Black communities, compared to White communities, are disproportionately targeted with more unhealthy food advertisements on television and social media. Exposure to unhealthy food and beverage marketing is associated with appetitive sensations, purchase intention, and intake behaviors, which may contribute to poor overall diet quality and worsening nutritional disparities in Black communities. Despite the negative effects, food and beverage companies are expanding their reach and harnessing advanced technology to create immersive experiences using virtual reality (VR). Black young adults may be uniquely vulnerable.
We aim to explore the effect of a VR-based fast-food marketing experience (compared with a VR-based nonfood control) on purchase intention, arousal, and hunger in a sample of Black and White young adults.
We will recruit 200 Black and White young adults (aged 18-24 years) from the New York City metropolitan area for a 1-time, 2-hour laboratory-based study. After screening and obtaining informed consent, eligible participants will be randomized to 1 of 2 VR conditions: a VR-based fast-food marketing experience (Wendyverse; experimental) or a VR-based nonfood control (Nikeland). In the Wendyverse, users can order from the restaurant operated by Wendy’s, play games, meet others who may be visiting the Wendyverse, and access codes that can be used to obtain free food at physical restaurants. The control condition will be the Nikeland app, where participants can play sports, try on apparel, and engage with celebrity athletes. Study personnel will provide a 5-minute training session to participants before beginning the experiment to ensure that they feel comfortable in the VR environment. Participants will otherwise engage with the VR app independently. The primary outcomes will be fast-food purchase intention, assessed via a self-report questionnaire; arousal, assessed via electrodermal activity or skin conductance; and hunger, assessed via salivary reactivity. We will also conduct secondary analyses to examine interactions by race, ethnicity, and food or nutrition insecurity as a proxy for socioeconomic status. Analyses of covariance and multiple linear regressions will be conducted to examine the effects of VR-based fast-food marketing exposure on the relevant outcomes (compared to the control).
This study was funded by the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities in September 2024. Recruitment is expected to begin in September 2025. We expect to complete data collection by October 2026 and begin data cleaning and analysis in November 2026.
On the basis of previous research and data, we anticipate that young adults randomized to view VR-based food and beverage marketing will self-report higher purchase intention and demonstrate stronger arousal and hunger. The data will be used to support future research and improve the understanding of the effects of digital forms of unhealthy food and beverage marketing on young people.

<h2 id="article-13">13. Perceptions of Occupational Risk and Adherence to Tuberculosis Prevention Among Health Care Workers: Protocol for a Scoping Review.</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: JMIR research protocols

<h3 id="摘要-12">摘要</h3>
<p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health problem around the world. Health care workers (HCWs) are at a much higher risk of contracting TB because they are often working around sick people in clinical settings. Even though HCWs play a key role in controlling TB, we still do not fully understand how they see this risk and how it affects their willingness to follow preventive measures.
This study aims to examine the existing body of knowledge on HCWs’ perceived risks of TB and how these perceptions impact their adherence to TB prevention measures. The results of this scoping review will identify gaps in the current literature that should inform policy and practice and guide future research studies to optimize TB prevention among HCWs.
This scoping review will be conducted following the framework proposed by Arksey and O’Malley, incorporating the recent advancements. This approach involves 6 key stages: identifying the research question; identifying relevant studies; selecting studies; charting the data; collating, summarizing, and reporting the results; and consulting with stakeholders.
As of June 2024, 1345 records were identified (1234 from databases and 111 from other sources), and 667 duplicates were removed. The remaining 678 records were screened by title and abstract, with 216 progressing to full-text review. After applying the eligibility criteria, 42 studies were included in the final analysis. Screening and full-text assessments were conducted between September and October 2024. Data extraction and thematic analysis were performed in winter 2024. The final data synthesis stage is expected to be completed by 2025.
HCWs’ perceptions of risk have a considerable effect on how well they follow TB prevention measures such as using personal protective equipment and undergoing health screenings. Lack of resources, lack of training, and the stigma around TB are some of the main barriers to TB prevention adherence. The thematic analysis showed that adherence levels were different depending on the support offered by the institution and the TB knowledge level and perception of each HCW. Although TB treatment has become more effective, nosocomial infections are still a big concern, especially in low- and middle-income countries like Indonesia, where HCWs are more likely to have latent TB infections. This review shows how important it is for HCWs to understand how TB prevention behaviors work. To improve HCW adherence, the gaps in institutional support, stigma, and training must be filled. Future interventions should be based on the specific problems found in low- and middle-income countries. This will make health care safer for everyone around the world.

<h3 id="摘要-13">摘要</h3>
<p>As rapidly aging populations become a worldwide phenomenon, early detection and prompt management of chronic disease become essential to support healthy aging. Community-based health screenings, a key component of this strategy, often struggle with poor follow-up rates, limiting their long-term impact. Given the untapped potential of youth volunteers and the urgent need for a scalable approach to improve continuity of care post health screenings, we developed HealthStart: a structured, theory-based program that empowers these older adults to take greater ownership of their health and their chronic conditions with the support of youth community health volunteers (CHVs).
This study aimed to describe the development, implementation, and early outcomes of HealthStart-an intergenerational, layperson-led health coaching program-and summarize operational lessons to guide similar models in Asian communities.
HealthStart adopted an intergenerational service-learning approach modeled on a self-determination theory-based layperson-led health coaching framework. Each HealthStart team consisted of 1 health care volunteer (HCV) and 4 youth CHVs. All volunteers underwent blended training and were assessed for layperson-led health coaching readiness. Between September 2022 and June 2023 in Singapore, youth CHVs empowered adult participants aged 40 years and older after their health screening to (1) learn about their chronic diseases, (2) learn at least one digital health app, (3) enroll with a primary care provider, and (4) set a lifestyle goal (based on the Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic/Relevant, and Time-bound [SMART] framework for goal setting) and achieve it. We used an implementation-focused case study design using descriptive statistics and volunteer-participant feedback to evaluate feasibility and outcomes.
Of 236 eligible individuals, 192 enrolled. Participants had a mean age of 67 (SD 9.6) years; 52.1% (n=100) of participants were female, with a majority of Chinese ethnicity, having completed primary or secondary school education, residing in self-owned flats, and living in 3-room public housing. Follow-up rate with primary care increased from 42.7% (82/148) preprogram to 84.5% (125/148) postprogram (χ21=43; P&lt;.001). In total, 58 HCVs were recruited, comprising 26 nurses and 6 doctors, with the remainder as allied health professionals. A total of 33 were trained and deployed. The mean age of HCVs was 37 years old, and 24 (72.7%) were female. Furthermore, 149 youth CHVs were recruited, 138 trained, and 102 deployed. The mean age of the youth CHVs who were deployed was 24 years, and 75 (73.5%) were female. Reflections included the importance of volunteer competency and selection criteria, tiering of participant intervention, tapping on community assets, adoption of a social prescription framework, importance of alignment with population health policies, and cultivating intergenerational relationships.
HealthStart demonstrates the feasibility and acceptability of a structured, intergenerational, layperson-led health coaching model embedded in primary care. We identify key lessons learned in the conceptualization and implementation of the program that may inform the design of similar volunteer-enabled initiatives for harnessing laypersons, an often-underused asset, to promote health in the community.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-14">摘要</h3>
<p>This cross-sectional study using observational methods study was conducted in 2022 to investigate risky driving behaviors among 3005 drivers in various areas of Tabriz, the largest city in northwest Iran. Observations were made when drivers stopped at intersections or before entering their government workplace.
Observational sites represented low, middle, and high income areas, and locations serving local areas, commuting areas, and workplaces. Observations occurred at various times of day and were conducted by recording drivers’ behavior using a checklist based on the Martinez-Sanchez method. Chi-square and binary logistic regression analyses examined relations between demographic variables and drivers’ behavior.
Among the observed drivers, 67.39% failed to use seat belts, 29.72% used mobile phones while driving, and 74.24% stopped beyond the stop line. Women used seat belts 1.64 times more often than men [OR = 1.64; 95% CI: 1.36-1.97]. Drivers estimated to be under 25 years and aged 25-40 years used mobile phones significantly more often than drivers estimated to be over age 50 [OR = 2.65; 95% CI: 1.96-3.60], [OR = 1.75; 95% CI: 1.34-2.30]. Drivers were significantly more likely to use mobile phones on weekends than during the week [OR =1.49; 95% CI: 1.15-1.93] and at noon compared to the morning [OR = 1.25; 95% CI: 1.03-1.53]. Drivers observed in middle socioeconomic status (SES) locations failed to fasten seat belts 1.23 times more frequently than drivers in high SES areas [OR = 1.23; 95% CI: 1.01-1.51]. Drivers at workplaces and in local areas failed to fasten their seat belts 2.07 and 1.78 times more than drivers in commuting areas, respectively [OR = 2.07; 95% CI: 1.71-2.49; OR = 1.78; 95% CI: 1.45-2.17].
In summary, we observed considerable risk-taking behavior among drivers in Tabriz, Iran, with the highest risk occurring among male and younger drivers. Multifaceted intervention programs and policymaking, building off successful programs in other countries, should be implemented to increase safe driving behaviors.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-15">摘要</h3>
<p>Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an endogenous gasotransmitter that possesses multiple pathological and physiological functions, including anti-inflammation, anti-thrombosis, anti-calcification, inhibition of intimal hyperplasia, and promotion of angiogenesis. Therefore, we aim to design an H2S-releasing resorbable synthetic graft that utilizes the therapeutic benefits of the H2S to modulate the graft regeneration. To ease fabrication of the H2S-releasing graft, we have designed a pair of functional polyesters that are electrospinnable and photocurable to form an elastic fibrous conduit. The conduit bears free thiol groups that are conjugated with a methacrylated H2S donor through thiol-ene click chemistry to form an H2S-releasing graft. The graft can sustainably release H2S over ∼12 days in vitro. Differing from prior designs, the H2S-releasing graft simultaneously possesses key features of a robust elasticity, and suitable mechanical properties, degradation rate and porosity. At the proof-of-concept stage, we examined the H2S stimulation on endothelial cell growth using the graft with a low H2S releasing rate. The results demonstrated that the graft with sustained H2S release could significantly promote endothelial cell growth in vitro. This work paved the way for in vivo evaluation of the H2S-releasing graft.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-16">摘要</h3>
<p>BackgroundThe importance of compassion and compassionate care, as an indicator for quality care, has been well acknowledged in recent years within health care. However, there are some international concerns about the state of compassion in the contemporary healthcare systems. There are many factors that facilitate or inhibit the provision of compassion in clinical settings.ObjectiveThis meta-synthesis of qualitative studies aimed to explore healthcare providers’ perceived barriers and facilitators to compassion in healthcare settings.MethodsA systematic review and meta-synthesis of qualitative studies were used in this study. Five electronic databases including Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed/Medline, CINAHL, and PsycINFO were searched to identify relevant studies. In this meta-synthesis, Thomas and Harden’s thematic analysis approach was undertaken to synthesize the findings of the qualitative studies.ResultsA total of 20 papers were selected for meta-synthesis. The data analysis resulted in the development of three main themes for barriers to compassion: (a) organizational or systemic challenges, (b) personal and individual factors, and (c) patient and family-related factors. Moreover, three main themes for facilitators to compassion emerged from data analysis: (a) supportive organizational culture, (b) personal capacity for compassion, and (c) patient and family reactions.ConclusionThis meta-synthesis showed some barriers and facilitating factors for developing high-quality compassionate care. Understanding factors that influence compassionate care delivery may improve the cultivation of compassionate care. Moreover, identifying these challenges and facilitators provides a comprehensive framework through which healthcare providers, policy makers, and healthcare organizations can assess their own strategies to identify how compassion could be cultivated and developed in healthcare settings. It may inform practical strategies and interventions tailored to foster the delivery of compassionate care in each healthcare setting and improve the quality of care and health outcomes.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-17">摘要</h3>
<p>Early prediction of treatment outcomes for patients with multidrug-resistant or rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/RR-TB) undergoing extended therapy is crucial for enhancing clinical prognoses and preventing the transmission of this deadly disease. However, the absence of validated predictive models remains a significant challenge.
This study compared a conventional logistic regression model with machine learning (ML) models using demographic and clinical data to predict outcomes at 2 and 6 months of treatment for MDR/RR-TB. The goal was to advance model applications, refine control strategies, and boost MDR/RR-TB cure rates.
This retrospective study encompassed an internal cohort of 744 patients with MDR/RR-TB examined between January 2017 and June 2023, as well as an external cohort comprising 137 patients with MDR/RR-TB examined between March 2021 and June 2022. Data on culture conversion were collected at 2 and 6 months, and culture conversion was tracked in the external cohort at the same time points. The internal cohort was assigned as the training set, whereas the external cohort was used as the validation set. Logistic regression and 7 ML models were developed to predict the culture conversion of patients with MDR/RR-TB at 2 and 6 months of treatment. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.
In the internal cohort, culture conversion rates for MDR/RR-TB were 81.9% (485/592) at 2 months and 87.1% (406/466) at 6 months. The odds ratio for treatment success was 8.55 (95% CI 3.31-22.08) at 2 months and 20.33 (95% CI 6.90-59.86) at 6 months after conversion, with sensitivities of 86.5% and 92.2% and specificities of 57.1% and 63.2%, respectively. The artificial neural network model was the best for culture conversion at both 2 and 6 months of treatment, with areas under the curve of 0.82 (95% CI 0.77-0.86) and 0.90 (95% CI 0.86-0.93), respectively. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the model were 0.74, 0.74, and 0.75 at 2 months of treatment and 0.80, 0.79, and 0.87 at 6 months of treatment, respectively.
The ML models based on 2- and 6-month culture conversion could accurately predict treatment outcomes for patients with MDR/RR-TB. ML models, particularly the artificial neural network model, outperformed the logistic regression model in both stability and generalizability and offer a rapid and effective tool for evaluating therapeutic efficacy in the early stages of MDR/RR-TB treatment.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-18">摘要</h3>
<p>Migration is a recognized social determinant in the world. Chile has experienced an abrupt increase in immigration in recent years, demanding, among other things, health care services. The aim of this study was to compare the profile of hospital discharges between nationals and migrants in Chile.
An observational study was conducted using routinely collected health data, analyzing the database of hospital discharges of the Ministry of Health in the decade between 2013 and 2022.
There were 16 013 995 hospital discharges (95% Chilean and 2% foreigners), with higher proportions in the north of the country. Departures of foreigners show a steady increase, rising sixfold over the decade (from 0.7 to almost 4%). There are significant differences in the distribution by sex (Chileans: 41.2% men/58.8% women; foreigners: 22.4% men/77.6% women). According to age, in both populations, the highest frequency of discharges occurred between 20 and 39 years of age (30.3% in Chileans and 68.7% in foreigners). Death at discharge occurred in 2.4% of Chileans and 0.9% of foreigners. The most frequent diagnosis of discharge was the pregnancy, delivery and puerperium’ group, with significant differences (20% Chileans and 58.5% foreigners). Chileans have a higher proportion of cardiovascular diagnosis (12.1% versus 7.5%) and respiratory diseases (13.2% versus 7.5%), while foreigners have a higher proportion of trauma, poisoning and other external causes (13.9% Chileans versus 22.1% foreigners).
The growth of the immigrant population has increased the demand for hospital resources, requiring adjustments in planning and resource allocation. It is suggested that inclusive policies focus on prioritizing maternal-child care and accident and injury prevention for migrants.
La migración es un reconocido determinante social en el mundo. Chile ha experimentado un abrupto aumento de inmigración en los últimos años, demandando, entre otros, servicios de atención de salud. El objetivo del estudio es comparar el perfil de egresos hospitalarios entre nacionales y migrantes en Chile.
Se realizó un estudio observacional con datos rutinariamente recolectados, analizando la base de datos de egresos hospitalarios del Ministerio de Salud en la década comprendida entre los años 2013 y 2022.
Se produjeron 16 013 995 egresos (95% chilenos, 2% extranjeros y 3% sin información). Los egresos de extranjeros presentan un alza mantenida, aumentado seis veces en la década (de 0,7% a casi 4%) y con mayores proporciones en el norte del país. Existen diferencias significativas en la distribución por sexo (chilenos: 41,2% hombres y 58,8% mujeres; extranjeros: 22,4% hombres y 77,6% mujeres). Según edad, en ambas poblaciones la mayor frecuencia de egresos ocurrió entre los 20 y 39 años (30,3% en chilenos y 68,7% en extranjeros). El resultado de fallecimiento al egreso ocurrió en 2,4% de chilenos y 0,9% de extranjeros. El diagnóstico de egreso más frecuente fue el grupo embarazo, parto y puerperio, con diferencias significativas (20% chilenos y 58,5% extranjeros). Los chilenos presentan mayor proporción de diagnósticos cardiovasculares (12,1% versus 7,5%) y de enfermedades respiratorias (13,2 versus 7,5%), mientras que en extranjeros hay mayor proporción del grupo de traumatismos, envenenamientos y otras causas externas (13,9% chilenos versus 22,1% extranjeros).
El crecimiento de la población inmigrante ha aumentado la demanda de recursos hospitalarios, exigiendo ajustes en la planificación y asignación de recursos. Se sugiere enfocar políticas inclusivas hacia la priorización de la atención materno infantil y prevención de accidentes y traumatismos en migrantes.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-19">摘要</h3>
<p>This systematic review (PROSPERO ID: CRD42022356654, AMNR junior research grant) evaluated the effectiveness of parenting interventions in pediatric type 1 diabetes, designed to enhance supportive parenting behaviors, in improving family dynamics, parent-, child-, and diabetes-related outcomes.
We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, CINAHL, and PsycINFO for studies from 1980 to February 25, 2025. We included reports of controlled and uncontrolled studies describing quantitative change. Data were synthesized narratively, and intervention content was coded according to a behavioral taxonomy. Risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane’s Risk of Bias (2.0) tool and the ROBINS-I tool for controlled and uncontrolled studies, respectively.
After screening 12,654 reports, we included 51 studies (across 72 reports) describing findings of 37 unique interventions. Most studies and outcomes had an increased risk of bias. Whereas overall effects were mixed, intensive, targeted interventions had the most impact on psychosocial and diabetes outcomes. Some preventive interventions and, notably, control groups also showed effects, with most promising effects in subgroups. Many preventive intervention studies were underpowered. A diabetes-specific focus seemed necessary, although not sufficient, to affect diabetes outcomes. Several strategies were used to stimulate parents toward changing their own and-ultimately-their children’s behavior, although individual components could not be uniquely related to intervention effectiveness.
Targeted and preventive parenting interventions serve as a potential, although not exclusive, approach to improve psychosocial and diabetes outcomes. Future research should elucidate which families benefit from parenting interventions compared to other educational or supporting interventions, thereby delineating their essential intervention components.</p>

<p>The new Schiff base ligand N,N’-thiophene-(bis-1-ethyl-6,8-difluoro-7-(3-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid) (H2L) was synthesized via condensation of thiophene-2,5-diamine with lomefloxacin in ethanol using glacial acetic acid. H2L reacted as tetradentate ligand with chromium(III), manganese(II), and cobalt(II). The synthesized compounds were characterized using elemental analysis, molar conductivity (Λm), magnetic susceptibility (µeff), FTIR, UV-Vis, GC-MS, and thermal studies were employed to ensure the chelation process. Infrared measurements confirmed that H2L chelated with metal ions via the carboxylate oxygen and nitrogen of the azomethine group also, with water molecules. UV-Vis and magnetic moment data supported octahedral geometries for all complexes. The calculated optical band gap energy (Eg) values suggested that our complexes were more electro-conductive relative to H2L. Thermal analyses revealed the presence of significant lattice and coordinated water molecules within the complexes’ coordination spheres. Thermodynamic parameters including activation energy, entropy change, enthalpy change, and Gibbs free energy change were derived using Coats-Redfern and Horowitz-Metzger methods. Disc diffusion method was implemented for assessing antimicrobial effects versus some pathogenic microorganisms. The data revealed that Cr(III) complex as most effective against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Cytotoxicity tests on normal prostate epithelial cells (IC50 = 6.30-10.43 µM) indicated significant toxicity and limited selectivity, restricting anticancer applicability.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-21">摘要</h3>
<p>Orbiviruses are emerging pathogens of public and veterinary health concern. This study reports the discovery and genomic characterization of a novel orbivirus in adult ticks collected from African savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana) in Kafue National Park, Zambia. Six ticks were identified through genetic analyses; one Rhipicephalus maculatus and five Amblyomma tholloni. Salivary gland and blood meal samples were dissected for virus characterization. Total nucleic acids were extracted and reverse-transcribed, and libraries were prepared for deep sequencing. De novo assembly of trimmed sequences recovered four novel viruses designated “zaloxo” to indicate their association with Zambian elephants (genus Loxodonta), abbreviated ZXLV-1 to ZXLV-4. ZXLV-1, a member of the genus Orbivirus, belongs to the same subclade of dsRNA orbiviruses as bluetongue virus, epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus, and African horse sickness virus. ZXLV-2 and ZXLV-3 are most closely related to dsRNA Totiviridae and ssDNA Circoviridae viruses, respectively. ZXLV-4 belongs to the genus Alphapolyomavirus, dsDNA viruses which are ubiquitous in mammals but have unclear associations with disease. While the pathogenicity of these viruses remains unclear, these results suggest that a hidden diversity of viruses likely exists in elephant ectoparasites, warranting attention from the perspective of both health and conservation.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-22">摘要</h3>
<p>Seasonal influenza vaccines have the potential to prevent significant morbidity and mortality and the World Health Organization recommends that all countries consider implementing seasonal influenza immunization programmes. These provide invaluable supports to pandemic response, whether through the utilization of influenza epidemiological surveillance systems such as the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) or RespiMart, by imparting countries with ability to scale up vaccination in response to pandemics, and by contributing to the global production capacity for vaccines. During the COVID-19 pandemic, countries with higher influenza vaccination coverage also achieved higher COVID-19 vaccination coverage. But vaccine hesitancy and complacency are preventing optimal benefits from seasonal influenza vaccination. In 2008, the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations’ (IFPMA) Influenza Vaccine Supply International Task Force (IVS) developed a survey method to estimate vaccination coverage rates. The present survey, for 2022 and 2023, highlights that the vast improvements in seasonal influenza vaccination coverage rates achieved during 2020 and 2021 are regrettably not being sustained. Twenty-seven fewer countries in 2022 and 29 fewer countries in 2023 distributed any doses of seasonal influenza than in the peak year for number of countries, 2011. In 2023 there were 17 % fewer vaccine doses distributed globally than in the peak year, 2020. Only 33 of 195 countries achieved the hurdle rate in 2023, defined as number of doses distributed to ≥15.9 % of the population. Governments can strengthen performance of their seasonal influenza vaccination programs with a few key actions. Because immunization returns up to 19 times the cost in societal value, it is critical for governments to identify and implement appropriate countermeasures to vaccine hesitancy and complacency including vaccine advocacy, communications, and communication training for Healthcare Workers. Governments’ challenge is to sustain resolve beyond the public health emergency of COVID-19.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-23">摘要</h3>
<p>Seasonal influenza can cause variable respiratory infections and severe complications, and vaccination remains essential for infection control. Nevertheless, substantial inter-individual variability in vaccine immune responses persists, and the molecular determinants remain poorly defined. This study aimed to elucidate the temporal gene expression patterns and immune cell dynamics associated with vaccine response through longitudinal transcriptomic and immune cell data.
We utilized gene expression, immune cell composition, and immune response data from Immune Signatures Data Resource (IS2). Differential expression and time-series analyses identified key transcriptional features and dynamic patterns linked to vaccine response. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) revealed gene modules associated with vaccine response and elucidating their pathway enrichment characteristics. Finally, the linear mixed-effects model was used to examine the temporal trends of 12 immune cell subsets across response groups, while generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) were employed to assess associations between differential expression genes and immune cell.
Overall analysis revealed the most differential expression genes at day 1 post-vaccination and time-series analysis identified 15 genes with significant dynamic changes. Notably, interferon-stimulated genes GBP1 and GBP2 exhibited transient upregulation in high responders, showing significant positive correlation with antibody titer increases. WGCNA analysis identified 3 immune response-associated modules that were primarily enriched in immune regulation and cell signaling pathways. Immune cell analysis revealed a distinct biphasic pattern of Naive B cells in the high responders. Furthermore, JAG2 was found to be associated with multiple immune cell populations. These findings reveal a complex regulatory network underlying influenza vaccine response.
Our study highlights the importance of early gene expression and dynamic immune cell changes following influenza vaccination in shaping the immune response. The identification of transiently regulated genes alongside specific immune cell dynamics suggests they may serve as key determinants of vaccine response.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-24">摘要</h3>
<p>Walkability notably affects the health of older adults; however, its relationship with various outcomes in different geographical contexts remains unclear. Considering urban-rural differences, this study examined associations between neighborhood walkability and the health and well-being of older adults in Japan.
Data were obtained from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study, a nationwide cohort study of Japanese adults aged ≥65 years, across three waves (2013, 2016, and 2019). This study included 27,354 participants in the survey-based sample and 40,111 participants in the long-term care insurance-based sample. Neighborhood walkability was assessed using a composite index derived from population density, distance to retail and park areas, and road density. Forty-two outcomes across seven domains were analyzed using multilevel regression models stratified by urbanicity. Bonferroni correction was applied (α = 0.0012).
In urban settings, higher walkability was significantly associated with increased walking time. Conversely, in rural areas, higher walkability showed mixed results; it was significantly associated with increased participation in hobby/sports groups and outings, but also with increased risk of functional disability (level ≥2), increased sedentary behavior, and decreased norms of reciprocity. Walkability was not significantly associated with walking time.
Walkability can have different effects on health and well-being in urban and rural areas, highlighting the need for location-specific strategies. While urban efforts could focus on pedestrian infrastructure, effective rural strategies would likely involve an integrated approach that addresses transportation, social connectivity, and activity promotion.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-25">摘要</h3>
<p>Cigarette smoking is prevalent among adults with intellectual disability (ID), yet much remains to be understood about their smoking and cessation experiences, contributing to ongoing healthcare inequalities. This study aims to understand smoking experiences and cessation barriers and facilitators among people with ID in residential services, using a multiperspective approach.
This qualitative study involved 10 adults with ID who smoked cigarettes daily and 10 support professionals purposively recruited from residential services. In-depth face-to-face interviews were conducted to explore experiences of tobacco use and cessation. Data were analyzed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis.
Six superordinate themes emerged: (1) smoking initiation as a social behavior and identity construction; (2) current smoking as a daily routine, shared activity, and source of gratification; (3) access to cigarettes and smoking regulation by support professionals; (4) ambivalent motivation to quit, with health concerns as transient triggers; (5) cessation barriers, including risk minimization, social influences, low self-efficacy, and limited knowledge of interventions; and (6) perceived cessation aids, including distraction and social support. Certain support practices-i.e., restricting access to cigarettes or using them as a reward-were experienced as limiting, underscoring tensions between health promotion and autonomy.
Findings highlight the need for rights-based, person-centered cessation approaches for people with ID. Cessation strategies should extend beyond pharmacology to include emotional, social, and environmental dimensions, while aligning with individuals’ values and experiences. Professionals require training to balance health promotion with self-determination. Future interventions should prioritize empowerment and provide tailored, evidence-based support addressing personal and contextual factors.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-26">摘要</h3>
<p>Nitrogen fertilizers are widely used in agricultural soils and are one of the significant sources of greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) emitted through the denitrification process. However, the driving factors and underlying mechanisms of N2O emissions from different soils after nitrate (NO3–N) fertilization via denitrification remain unclear. Herein, NO3–N fertilizer was applied into four different types of soils from Southern China with distinct physicochemical properties, and N2O emissions were measured through the anaerobic incubation experiment. Results showed that there were significant differences in N2O emissions among different types of soils, with a 43-fold difference between the highest and lowest N2O emissions. Soil pH, DOC, and Fe(Ⅱ) were the core factors determining the differences in N2O emissions for different types of soils. Specifically, in Gaoqiao (GQ) soil, the low pH and high concentrations of DOC and Fe(Ⅱ) stimulated the growth of microorganisms carrying denitrification functional genes (nirK and nirS), such as Clostridium, Desulfosporosinus, and Fonticella. This led to a decrease in the nosZ/(nirK + nirS) ratio and substantial accumulation of N2O. In contrast, the higher pH and lower concentrations of DOC and Fe(Ⅱ) in Wanshan (WS) paddy soil were conducive to the growth of microorganisms carrying the nosZ gene, such as Flavisolibacter, Mesobacillus, and norank_f__Vicinamibacteraceae, improving the nosZ/(nirK + nirS) ratio and decreasing N2O emissions. The differences in soil pH, DOC, and Fe(II) among different types of soils affect the composition of bacteria carrying denitrification functional genes, thereby influencing N2O emissions. Overall, the present study systematically elucidated the influencing factors and mechanisms of N2O emissions from different types of paddy soils and provided an important reference for lowering N2O emissions from agricultural soils.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-28">摘要</h3>
<p>Orientation-specific immobilization of antibodies (Abs) onto nanoparticles to maintain Abs-antigen recognition is one of the main strategies to improve immunochromatographic assay (ICA) performance. Inspired by an immune-network-based probe synthesis strategy, we proposed a novel immune-bridging mechanism utilizing the specific interaction between anti-Fc immunoglobulins (AFcI) and Abs. This enhanced affinity facilitates the construction of immune-network, thereby improving the stability of Abs binding. Herein, a bio-derived tracer, pupal-like CuGA (pCuGA), self-assembled from Cu2+ and gallic acid (GA) was developed and further modified with AFcI. This modification addresses potential Abs shedding caused by unstable carrier-Abs binding and enables synergistic Abs orientation for immune-network stabilization and signal amplification. The resulting tracer exhibits excellent biocompatibility and preserves Abs bioactivity through a simple stirring-based labeling process, eliminating the need for cumbersome chemical modification. Compared with the conventional pCuGA-Ab probe-based ICA, the pCuGA-AFcIAb probe-based ICA not only improved sensitivity by halving Ab consumption but also achieved significantly lower detection limits, with an IC10 of 0.019 ng/mL and a cut-off value of 3.00 ng/mL, representing at least 3.2- and 4.0-fold enhancements, respectively. Furthermore, the feasibility of the method was verified in chopsticks, fish, environmental water, fetal bovine serum, and shrimp paste samples, yielding satisfactory recoveries. The results of blind samples detection were consistent with those of liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. This study provides new possibilities for the functional modification of ICA tracers and paves the green road for ICA detection.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-29">摘要</h3>
<p>Oxidative stress, arising from a dysregulation between the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant defense mechanisms, is closely linked to the pathogenesis of numerous chronic diseases. To identify natural peptide-based antioxidants, rabbit meat proteins were enzymatically hydrolyzed using seven proteases. Among them, Hydrolysates produced by papain demonstrated the greatest radical scavenging activity, with DPPH and ABTS inhibition rates of 51.50 % and 61.50 %, respectively. Ultrafiltration and Sephadex G-15 fractionation revealed that the &lt;3 kDa fraction (PH3) and its subfraction F5 possessed the strongest antioxidant activity. LC-MS/MS analysis of F5 identified 163 peptides, of which 56 were predicted to exhibit antioxidant potential using PeptideRanker and AnOxPePred algorithms. Notably, seven novel peptides showed strong binding affinities to Keap1 (binding energy &lt; -8.0 kcal/mol) in molecular docking, suggesting possible modulation of the Keap1-Nrf2 antioxidant pathway. Quantum chemical analysis (HOMO-LUMO orbitals and electrostatic potential mapping) combined with radical scavenging assays demonstrated that electron-donating aromatic residues (Trp, Tyr) played key roles in antioxidant activity via hydrogen atom and electron transfer mechanisms, establishing a molecular-level structure-activity relationship. In vivo validation using an AAPH-induced zebrafish model confirmed the peptides’ safety and efficacy, including reduced ROS levels and restored endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD and CAT). Collectively, these findings provide mechanistic insight into the antioxidant action of rabbit-derived peptides and support their potential application as natural antioxidants for functional food development and oxidative stress-related disease prevention.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-30">摘要</h3>
<p>This paper describes the multifaceted realm of culture of mind, human rights and mental health and essential link between them. Culture plays an important part in modulating our personalities and how we view self and world we live in, how we interact with others, and how we understand, define and promote mental health and human rights as well as how we cope with mental illness. The intellectual legacy of Ciceron’s concept of cultura animi (culture of mind/soul) is today more relevant than ever. Narcissism, paranoidism, maniaism, depressiveness and nihilism today are more than individual mindsets and behavioral patterns. They are toxic cultural conditions and mindsets, modes of perception and mental orientations in the world, self-perception and interpersonal relationships. Toxic psycho-cultures refer to collective psychological and emotional climates in which harmful values, behaviors, and mental states are normalized, celebrated, or weaponized within a culture - particularly in family, political, institutional, or social environments. These psychocultures lead to alienation from oneself and others, erode mental health, civic trust, ethical norms, and human dignity/rights, often producing long-term damage across all layers of society, from family systems to global politics. Common dynamics of toxic psychocultures involves harmful behavior to be culturally acceptable (normalization), toxic emotions and beliefs spread through media and public discourse (contagion), toxic patterns are embedded in law, education, or policy (institutionalization), critical and holistic thinking and self-awareness are discouraged (suppression of reflection) and complex emotions are replaced by entitlement, admiration, suspiciousness, distrust, rage, cynicism, or numbness (emotional flattening). Empathic culture of mind involving human rights respect provides a powerful transformative vision of mental health promotion, protection and restoration.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-31">摘要</h3>
<p>Anxiety disorders are common, affecting about one-third of people globally and often persist despite standard treatments. Visual art therapy, involving guided creative activities such as drawing or painting, has emerged as a complementary approach to alleviate anxiety. We systematically reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effectiveness of visual art therapy for reducing anxiety in adults.
A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, Scopus, and Web of Science (October 2017-June 2025) was conducted. We included RCTs of adults (18-65 years) receiving a visual art therapy intervention (e.g., painting, drawing, coloring) versus any control condition. Fourteen RCTs (total N = 1,686) met the inclusion criteria.
All 14 trials found significantly greater anxiety reduction in art therapy groups compared to controls, with interventions ranging from a single 15-30 minute art-making session to 5-12 week art therapy programs. Anxiety scores improved more in art therapy participants across both clinical and high-stress non-clinical groups. Although no meta-analysis was performed due to heterogeneity, all trials reported positive outcomes for art-based interventions.
Current evidence strongly supports visual art therapy as an effective intervention for reducing anxiety symptoms in adults. It yields meaningful anxiety reductions across diverse formats (from brief art-making sessions to multi-week programs). As an accessible intervention complementing standard treatments, art therapy represents a valuable integrative approach to anxiety management.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-32">摘要</h3>
<p>From time to time, tragic cases occur when patients with serious Mental illness commit homicide. We describe two cases which are in the public domain.These cases are not isolated incidents but part of a broader, systemic failure to provide sustained, assertive, and well-resourced community-based mental health care. It is crucial that the techniques of Assertive Outreach we have discussed are not only adopted in principle but also fully integrated into everyday practice, backed by proper funding, staff training, and institutional support. Without this commitment, we risk continuing the tragic cycle of preventable deaths, where both patients with severe mental illness and innocent bystanders pay the price for gaps in the system. By applying assertive outreach models effectively, we have the opportunity to change the trajectory of care, ensuring that vulnerable individuals receive the intensive, proactive support they need to remain stable, safe, and ultimately, to prevent such tragedies from happening again.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-33">摘要</h3>
<p>By definition, adolescence is an age of transition, full of numerous small and major crises. Over the past few years, various data underscore the prominence of adolescent distress. In some cases, the malaise manifests through acting out and self-destructive behaviours. During adolescence, young people may experience a range of physical, emotional and social changes that can increase the risk of non-suicidal self-injury. Non-suicidal self-injury is a complex behaviour of intentionally inflicting pain or injury on oneself, frequently as mechanism to handle stress, anxiety, or other negative emotions. The scientific literature on self-injury is complex and multifactorial, encompassing several psychological, social, and biological factors. This paper describes the risk factors, the prevalence of the phenomenon, and its potential psychological meanings. Furthermore, 5 case reports are presented, involving female adolescents aged 15 to 18 who exhibit non-suicidal self-injury. Anamnestic data and each adolescent’s own life history were collected through in-person and online interviews in school-based listening services. Non-suicidal self-injury is a significant problem which requires an integrated prevention approach among the various stakeholders in the school system. Network synergy between school, family and social workers is crucial in order to promote the adolescent well-being.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-34">摘要</h3>
<p>Climate change is increasingly affecting not only physical health but also mental well-being. Psychological consequences such as eco-anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following climate-related disasters are being reported with growing frequency.
This study was conducted with mental health professionals who attended the Medforum Psychiatry Congress in 2024. A 22-question, closed-ended questionnaire was used to assess perceptions of the impact of climate change on mental health, the prevalence of eco-anxiety, and workplace preparedness for responding to climate-related disasters.
A total of 208 individuals participated in the survey. Of those, 51.9% rated the impact of climate change on mental health as moderate, and 13.9% considered it to be very significant. Although eco-anxiety is increasingly recognized by professionals, most admitted that they rarely encounter patients who report this issue directly.
Climate change affects mental health in two ways: directly, through the experience of disasters, and indirectly, by inducing chronic anxiety. Educational initiatives and the implementation of procedures to support mental health during climate-related crises are essential.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-35">摘要</h3>
<p>It is known that youth aged 16 to 23 are more vulnerable to mental distress than other age groups. This vulnerability can be explained by several factors such as the high prevalence of mental illnesses, the changes in the environment, the social expectations and so on. Moreover, in this age group the transition between Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) and Adult Mental Health Services (AMHS) impacts the continuity of care, leading to a negative impact on the prognosis. This article aims to characterize this population based on risk factors, history of care and care plan.
We conducted a retrospective study including patients who attended transition psychiatry consultations between October 2020 and December 2023. Data were collected at a secondary care outpatient service.
The sample (n=122) was predominantly female (70.5%, n=86). Referrals were mostly made by psychologists (35.2%, n=43), although many individuals were self-referred (32%, n=39). In most cases, the consultation request came directly from the young person (60.7%, n=74). Regarding previous mental health support, 79.5% (n=97) had already received psychological care at the time of their transition consultation. In terms of risk factors, many participants had been exposed to adverse childhood experiences (ACE): 60% (n=69) reported a first-degree family history of psychiatric disorders, 28% (n=33) had experienced sexual abuse, and 37.3% (n=44) had been exposed to domestic violence. Among those who received follow-up care, 19.7% (n=24) were scheduled for planned inpatient care. Psychotherapeutic follow-up was offered to 79.6% of patients, and psychotropic medication was recommended for 68.9%.
This research highlights the major vulnerability of transition-aged youth (TAY) and reinforces the need for specialized care and continuity between CAMHS and AMHS.</p>

<p>Food-related problems in Feeding and Eating Disorders (hereafter referred to as eating disorders - EDs) might be considered as the expression of dysfunctional individual and relational patterns based on emotional and behavioral dysregulation. Dysphoria is a transnosographic syndrome found in a multitude of psychiatric disorders including EDs, our cross-sectional study aims to analyze its presence in Anorexia Nervosa (AN), Bulimia Nervosa (BN) and Binge Eating Disorder (BED) to define its socio-demographic, clinical correlates and phenomenological expression in the three types of EDs.
A total of 165 patients were recruited from March 2019 to November 2024. Anamnestic history was collected through a specific form. The Italian version of the Nepean Dysphoria Scale (NDS-I) was used to evaluate Dysphoria. After performing descriptive analyses, one-way ANOVA and Pearson’s r test were performed to respectively assess between-group differences and correlations. Significance was defined as p&lt;0.05.
AN presented the highest degree of Dysphoria than the three, BED the lowest. Older age, physical illnesses and ongoing medical therapy correlated with lower levels of Dysphoria. A Statistically significant positive correlation was found in smoking habits, association with another psychiatric disorder, especially with anxiety disorder, use of benzodiazepines (BDZ) and use of antipsychotics (AP).
Dysphoria acquires fundamental importance within EDs, possibly having a specific role in the etiology and maintenance of eating behaviors, it might play a core role in this type of mental disorder, with the behavioral aspect aimed at reducing dysphoric anxiety. Understanding these connections could represent a useful tool for the comprehension of EDs, which are increasing and have always represented a great diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-37">摘要</h3>
<p>Healthcare workers (HCWs) face significant occupational stressors that increase their risk of psychological symptoms, including anxiety, depression, and burnout. In particular, nurse may experience higher psychological distress due to unique workplace demands. However, direct comparisons between nurses and other HCWs within tertiary care hospitals remain limited. This retrospective study aimed to compare work-related stress levels and mental health outcomes in nurses versus other HCWs seeking psychological or psychiatric support through the Occupational Health Service (OHS) of a tertiary care hospital in central Italy.
This is a retrospective cross-sectional study analyzing healthcare workers (HCWs) who accessed psychological or psychiatric support through an Occupational Counseling Service (OCS) over a three-year period. Medical records of 155 HCWs who accessed the OHS from January 2022 to December 2024 were reviewed. Sociodemographic, occupational, clinical, and psychometric data were collected. Subgroup analyses compared nurses (n=79) to other professionals (n=76) regarding psychological distress, psychiatric diagnoses, and treatment. Correlations between personal/family psychiatric history and work-related stress were also assessed.
Nurses exhibited significantly higher levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety compared to other HCWs. A positive personal and/or family history of anxiety and mood disorders was present in 26.5% of the full cohort and correlated significantly with work-related stress and burnout (p&lt;0.001). Burnout and secondary traumatic stress were prevalent across all groups, although compassion satisfaction remained relatively preserved.
Nurses demonstrated greater vulnerability to affective symptoms and work-related stress compared to other HCWs, underscoring the need for tailored mental health support within occupational health frameworks. Early identification and intervention strategies are crucial to mitigate psychological distress and improve wellbeing among hospital staff.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-38">摘要</h3>
<p>Binge Eating Disorder (BED) is a prevalent and under-recognized eating disorder associated with psychological distress and maladaptive coping. Healthcare professionals are frequently exposed to high levels of occupational stress, which may increase their vulnerability to disordered eating behaviors, including BED. This study aimed to explore the relationship between work-related stress, emotional exhaustion and the risk of developing binge eating symptoms among healthcare professionals in Italy.
A cross-sectional online survey was conducted between May and July 2024 among 312 healthcare professionals. Participants completed a structured questionnaire comprising sociodemographic data, stress-related variables, the Emotional Exhaustion subscale of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and the Binge Eating Scale (BES).
The sample was predominantly female (81.7%) with a mean age of 37.6 years. Twenty percent reported a history of eating disorders and 60.3% reported stress or anxiety. Significant associations were found between BES scores and stress-related variables, including anxiety, emotional exhaustion, eating during work breaks and vending machine use (p&lt; 0.005). Higher BES scores were correlated with burnout symptoms such as fatigue, emotional drain and inability to cope. A strong association also emerged between BES scores and the perceived impact of stress on eating habits.
Work-related stress and burnout symptoms are significantly associated with binge eating tendencies among healthcare professionals. Preventive strategies - such as institutional stress management programs and access to healthy food - are essential to promote well-being and prevent maladaptive eating behaviors in high-stress healthcare environments.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-39">摘要</h3>
<p>To estimate the relationship between cognitive function of patients with heart arrhythmias and left ventricle (LV) diastolic function.
In a one-center cross-control study we recruited 28 patients with heart arrhythmias, of whom 14 had 1800 or more premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) per 24 hours and more (group 1), and 14 had paroxysmal AF (group 2). All patients were asymptomatic for heart arrhythmias. Laboratory and instrumental methods included standard investigations: lipidograms, 24 hours ECG monitoring, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), and, if prescribed, coronary angiography. In the TTE protocol, we followed current clinical recommendations in assessing the LV diastolic function. For cognitive function evaluation, we used the standard Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test, with the following scoring: maximum possible score - 30 points; mild cognitive impairment - 22-27 points; moderate cognitive impairment - 10-21 points; severe cognitive impairment - 0-9 points.
The most common heart arrhythmias (frequent PVCs, paroxysmal AF) were associated with cognitive impairment in the preponderance of patients (mean score here).
LV diastolic dysfunction is a predictor for cognitive impairment in patients with frequent PVCs and paroxysmal AF. The MoCA test can be an additional tool for this category of patients to detect the early cognitive impairment.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-40">摘要</h3>
<p>Adolescents and young adults present elevated suicide risk, which remains a major public health concern. This study aims to characterize the clinical and psychosocial features of adolescents and young adults referred for psychiatric consultation after a suicide attempt.
We conducted a retrospective observational study at the University Hospital of Perugia, Italy, analyzing 72 patients aged 14-35 who received their first psychiatric evaluation during medical hospitalization. Patients were divided into two groups: those referred after a suicide attempt (SA group, n=36) and those referred for other psychiatric concerns (non-SA group, n=36). Data were extracted from structured consultation reports and included sociodemographic, clinical, and psychopathological variables. Bivariate analyses compared the two groups using appropriate statistical tests.
Compared to the non-SA group, the SA group had significantly higher rates of unemployment, positive psychiatric family history, previous suicide attempts, insomnia prior to admission, anxiety symptoms with both psychic and somatic features, personality disorders, and mood stabilizer use. SA patients also showed lower cooperativeness during interviews and were more likely to be assessed with suicidal ideation. More than one third of SA patients were assessed as euthymic post-attempt.
Key clinical markers of suicide risk in youths may include unemployment, family psychiatric history, insomnia, anxiety with somatic and psychic features, and personality disorders. The clinical profile of suicide attempters suggests a possible contribution of bipolar spectrum diathesis and affective dysregulation. Early, multidimensional risk assessment and integrated intervention strategies in liaison psychiatry are essential to improve detection and prevention of suicidality in youth.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-41">摘要</h3>
<p>Hoarding disorder (HD) is increasingly recognized as a distinct, multifactorial condition. Recent findings in neuroimaging, psychopathology, compulsive acquisition, suicidality, stigma, and social context call for a redefinition of HD beyond its traditional association with obsessive-compulsive disorder.
This narrative review synthesizes recent clinical, neurobiological, and sociocultural literature, including latent class analysis and resting-state fMRI studies, exploring cognitive dysfunction, comorbidities, suicidality, stigma, and environmental context.
HD is characterized by impaired executive functioning, frequently comorbid with ADHD and compulsive buying-shopping disorder. Subtype profiles identified through latent class analysis reveal complex multisymptomatic presentations. High rates of suicidality, social exclusion, and stigma - especially among individuals hoarding purchased items - suggest a need for a broader clinical and public health framework.
HD should be conceptualized within a neurodivergent and socially mediated model. Treatment and policy should address neurocognitive deficits, emotional regulation, social determinants, and stigma through interdisciplinary and person-centered interventions.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-42">摘要</h3>
<p>This paper describes the multifaceted realm of culture of mind, human rights and mental health and essential link between them. Culture plays an important part in modulating our personalities and how we view self and world we live in, how we interact with others, and how we understand, define and promote mental health and human rights as well as how we cope with mental illness. The intellectual legacy of Ciceron’s concept of cultura animi (culture of mind/soul) is today more relevant than ever. Narcissism, paranoidism, maniaism, depressiveness and nihilism today are more than individual mindsets and behavioral patterns. They are toxic cultural conditions and mindsets, modes of perception and mental orientations in the world, self-perception and interpersonal relationships. Toxic psycho-cultures refer to collective psychological and emotional climates in which harmful values, behaviors, and mental states are normalized, celebrated, or weaponized within a culture - particularly in family, political, institutional, or social environments. These psychocultures lead to alienation from oneself and others, erode mental health, civic trust, ethical norms, and human dignity/rights, often producing long-term damage across all layers of society, from family systems to global politics. Common dynamics of toxic psychocultures involves harmful behavior to be culturally acceptable (normalization), toxic emotions and beliefs spread through media and public discourse (contagion), toxic patterns are embedded in law, education, or policy (institutionalization), critical and holistic thinking and self-awareness are discouraged (suppression of reflection) and complex emotions are replaced by entitlement, admiration, suspiciousness, distrust, rage, cynicism, or numbness (emotional flattening). Empathic culture of mind involving human rights respect provides a powerful transformative vision of mental health promotion, protection and restoration.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-44">摘要</h3>
<p>Adolescent mental health has become an increasingly urgent concern, particularly in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mental Health Literacy (MHL) is emerging as a critical construct to promote psychological well-being, reduce stigma, and encourage the early recognition of psychological distress.
This study presents baseline data from a school-based pilot initiative conducted in a secondary school in Southern Italy. The aim was to assess students’ knowledge beliefs, and attitudes toward mental health prior to implementing targeted educational interventions. A total of 85 fifth-year students (mean age = 17.7 years) completed the Italian version of the Mental Health Literacy Questionnaire - short form (MHLq-short), administered anonymously via an online platform. Statistical analyses included descriptive measures and non-parametric tests to explore the association between MHL scores and familiarity with mental health problems.
Students who reported knowing someone with mental health issues exhibited a trend toward higher mental health literacy scores. In contrast, those who reported no such exposure or expressed uncertainty demonstrated lower average ranks, possibly reflecting limited awareness or emotional disengagement.
These findings highlight the potential role of personal experience in shaping mental health literacy and reinforce the need for structured, school-based interventions. To our knowledge, this study represents the first application of the MHLq-short in Italy and supports its feasibility in identifying literacy gaps among adolescents. Future initiatives could aim to replicate and scale this model across diverse educational settings and inform national strategies to integrate MHL into school curricula.</p>

<p>Children infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) exhibit the lowest neurodevelopmental scores. Mother-to-child-transmission prevention include perinatally and early antiretroviral therapy (ART) although long-term effects of in utero exposure to ART on neurodevelopment remain unclear. It was difficult to determine whether these reported neurodevelopmental scores were a direct result of HIV.
A systematic search was conducted to identify the environmental and neurobiological factors associated with HIV infection and their impact on neurodevelopment. It was carried out across four electronic databases: Scopus, PubMed, ProQuest and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. We selected 15 articles published between 2012 and 2024.
Regarding ART, 4 articles reported a positive effect of ART regardless of the age of initiation and duration. We couldn’t identify caregiver distress as a risk factor.
Further research should include large cohort studies assessing long term consequences of ART exposition on children’s neurodevelopment and impact of caregiver distress on child neurodevelopmental outcomes.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-48">摘要</h3>
<p>Characters in George Orwell’s novel “1984” have certain behavioral features which may be taken as pathological. We hypothesized that Winston Smith in particular suffers from chronic mild depression, which is a result of external pressure from the fictional dystopian society (i.e., multimodal stress of childhood trauma, workplace strain, disrupted close relationships, emotional deprivation, feeling of loneliness, and unempathetic community). To confirm the hypothesis, we conducted a number of analyses of the English text of the novel “1984”.
Taking the full English text of “1984”, we analyzed its fragments of first-person narrative, such as Winston’s diary remarks and his speech during spoken communications as described in the novel. We then used the psycholinguistic method of clinical psycholinguistic analysis to analyze the text of Winston’s diary from the perspective of psycholinguistic typology of literary texts based on emotional-semantic dominance as developed by the philologist Valery Belyanin (2000). The Belyanin method entailed placing a focus on the fragments of the first-person narratives representing descriptions of characters’ emotions and feelings with subsequent determination of their type.
In the first diary excerpt, Winston’s writing consists of short, exclamatory phrases. He repeatedly uses the first-person singular pronouns and self-referential sentences, with simple and complex sentence structures. Lexical repetition is high, and emotional vocabulary emphasizes defiance and apathy. The second excerpt is purely declarative and reasoning-focused. It contains minimal stylistic markers, with present-tense verbs, no personal pronouns, and no emotional or figurative language. Key themes revolve around existential values, mortality, truth, and defiance against oppression. There is a notable absence of hedonic, familial, or self-realization themes, reinforcing a limited semantic focus aligned with existential distress. Winston Smith exhibits classic dysthymic markers, such as pervasive self-criticism, preoccupation with mortality, emotional heaviness, repetitive confessional style, and an undercurrent of hopeless defiance.
According to our psycholinguistic analysis of Winston Smiths’ diary text and dialogues, his language reflects depressive processing of personal and life experiences, reduced semantic productivity, fragmented meanings, and an emotionally negative dominant tone. Application of the psycholinguistic diagnostic model for mild depression confirms that his diary entries exhibit pronounced markers of mild depression of the melancholic and astheno-hypodynamic types. This analysis affirms the psychological insight applied by the author in developing his characters.</p>

<p>Leishmaniases are a vector-borne parasitic diseases with diverse clinical manifestations involving multiple Leishmania species and animal hosts. While most leishmaniasis cases are caused by a few well characterized Leishmania species, reports describe infections by unconventional or emerging Leishmania taxa, atypical clinical presentations from classical species, and occurrences of atypical Leishmania in animal hosts. These underrecognized infections present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges and are rarely reflected in surveillance systems or clinical guidelines. A systematic mapping of this evolving landscape is needed to guide future diagnostics, policy, and research priorities.
Following the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology and PRISMA-ScR guidelines, we will search PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), PROSPERO, Web of Science, and Global Index Medicus, as well as relevant grey literature. Eligible studies will include human cases with clinical presentations that diverge from those typically associated with well-characterized Leishmania species, reports involving unconventional or emerging Leishmania species, and animal cases of veterinary relevance caused by non-classical species, regardless of study design. Dual independent screening of records and data extraction using a standardized charting form will be conducted. Discrepancies between reviewers will be resolved by consensus. Data will be summarized descriptively through tables, figures, and thematic synthesis. Research gaps will be identified to inform future studies and public health strategies.
This review will use data from published sources and findings will be disseminated through publication in a peer-reviewed journal, presentations at scientific conferences, and sharing with relevant stakeholders. The results are intended to inform clinicians, researchers, and policymakers about the evolving landscape of leishmaniasis and to highlight priorities for future research and surveillance.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-53">摘要</h3>
<p>Psychiatric nurses represent a high-stress occupational group that experiences elevated levels of suicidal ideation (SI), emphasizing the need for focused mental health interventions. The main purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of SI among psychiatric nurses and to identify the psychological and occupational factors associated with SI. A total of 1,835 psychiatric nurses completed questionnaires on depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), SI, quality of work-related life (QWL), and burnout. Multivariate logistic regression and phenotypic network analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with SI and the potential pathways linking depressive symptoms, burnout, and QWL to SI. The results indicated that 11.33% of the participants had SI in the past two weeks. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, personal accomplishment, stress at work, general well-being, and the home-work interface were significant predictors of SI. Network analysis further revealed that psychomotor changes, guilt, sad mood, low energy, and appetite changes were the symptoms most directly associated with SI. In addition, sad mood, general well-being, and work-home interface were linked to job and career satisfaction, whereas sad mood and low energy were associated with emotional exhaustion and SI. These findings contribute valuable large-scale evidence on the mental health challenges faced by psychiatric nurses and highlight the importance of addressing mood disturbances, energy loss, and work-related stress in SI prevention efforts for this vulnerable group.</p>
