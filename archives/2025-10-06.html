<h3 id="摘要">摘要</h3>
<p>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common pregnancy complication with rising incidence and adverse maternal-fetal outcomes. Genetic polymorphisms in folate metabolism genes may influence GDM susceptibility through homocysteine pathway alterations. To investigate the associations between MTHFR (C677T, A1298C) and MTRR (A66G) polymorphisms and GDM risk, including gene‒gene interactions, in Chinese Han pregnant women, this retrospective cohort study analyzed 1312 Chinese Han pregnant women. The MTHFR C677T, A1298C, and MTRR A66G polymorphisms were genotyped using allele-specific PCR. Polymorphism-GDM associations were assessed using logistic regression, adjusting for maternal age, prepregnancy BMI, and folate intake. Gene‒gene interactions were evaluated using multiplicative interaction models. After confounder adjustment, the MTHFR 677TT genotype was associated with GDM (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.24-2.93) compared to wild-type. The MTRR 66AG and 66GG genotypes were associated with GDM, with ORs of 2.73 (95% CI: 1.93-3.89) and 3.10 (95% CI: 1.72-5.41), respectively. Significant gene‒gene interactions were observed between MTHFR C677T &amp; A1298C (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.25-4.23 for TT/AA combination) and MTHFR C677T &amp; MTRR A66G (OR 6.06, 95% CI 3.48-14.10 for TT/AG combination), indicating synergistic effects that surpass the expected multiplicative combination of individual polymorphism effects. MTHFR C677T and MTRR A66G polymorphisms independently and interactively increase GDM odds in Chinese Han women, enabling personalized risk prediction and targeted prevention.</p>

<h2 id="article-2">2. An Overview of West African Traditional Soft Cheese: Processing, Safety, and Quality Characteristics.</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: Comprehensive reviews in food science and food safety

<h3 id="摘要-1">摘要</h3>
<p>West African soft cheese (WASC) is widely consumed and nutritionally valuable across West Africa. It also sustains livelihoods, particularly among Fulani households, by providing regular income for women and strengthens household food security and autonomy. However, concerns persist about its safety and quality. A scoping review was conducted to synthesize evidence on WASC processing, safety, and quality. The findings showed that cow’s milk (88.6%) and Calotropis procera (77.1%) were the predominant milk source and coagulant, respectively. Two research areas contribute to about one third of the total articles reviewed: alternative coagulants (22.9%) and partial substitution of cow’s milk (11.4%). Among the various coagulants tested, only Carica papaya consistently achieved yields comparable to Cal. procera. Partial substitution with plant-based milks differentially influenced yield and composition. Findings indicated frequent microbiological hazards in market-sold WASC, with aerobic plate counts often exceeding limits and recurrent reports of coliforms and pathogens (e.g., Escherichia coli, Salmonella). In contrast, WASC produced under controlled laboratory conditions showed low aerobic counts and the absence of coliforms. In general, reporting quality was a major limitation, as most of the studies reviewed failed in reporting key processing parameters such as heating temperatures and times, coagulant concentration, and coagulation time, factors essential for assessing and reproducing cheese quality. In conclusion, this review underscores the urgent need for hygiene interventions across the value chain. Moreover, comprehensive research is needed to assess how different coagulants, extraction methods, heating conditions, and the alternatives could affect the yield, sensory characteristics, and overall quality of WASC.</p>

<p>This research, situated within the context of in vitro fertilisation as a care service, demonstrates how the male reproductive body is strategically foregrounded and subsequently marginalised in attributing infertility causes. Based primarily on interviews with 43 fertility clinicians in Taiwan, this study shows that during initial consultations, cultural norms discouraging male participation in the diagnostic process prompt clinicians to incorporate the male reproductive body. Issues related to sperm count, motility and morphology are emphasised, underscoring paternal responsibility for ‘failing to naturally conceive’. However, as IVF care proceeds, these sperm-related concerns are perceived as resolved through adopting clinical technology-intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Additionally, disparities in scientific knowledge about the genetic contributions of sperm and eggs lead clinicians to downplay the potential negative genetic impact of sperm on embryo development. Consequently, when discussing the responsibility for ‘the failed IVF outcome’, the male reproductive body is marginalised and a form of paternal genetic responsibility is rendered obscure. Existing scholarship scrutinises the predominant emphasis on maternal responsibility while relegating men to peripheral roles in reproductive ‘faulty’ outcomes or after conception. This research instead argues that the gendered assignment of responsibility within the biomedicalisation of reproduction is a multistaged, dynamically complex process shaped by socioclinical factors.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-3">摘要</h3>
<p>To estimate the potential impact of physical activity (PA) on the forecast prevalence and economic cost of dementia among Brazilian adults.
We analyzed data from the 2019 Brazilian National Health Survey to estimate PA levels. Dementia-related costs in 2019 were combined with prevalence data from the Global Burden of Disease Study. We estimated dementia cases and costs that could be averted if physical inactivity (&lt;150 minutes/week of moderate-to-vigorous PA) were eliminated. A counterfactual scenario assessed the effect of small increases in moderate (MPA) or vigorous (VPA) PA per week in adults who currently engage in zero minutes of PA per week.
In 2019, 14.9% of dementia cases in Brazil were attributable to physical inactivity, corresponding to 569,548 preventable cases by 2050. This would translate into R$23.1 billion (i.e., US$9.3 billion) in avoidable economic burden, of which R$20.2 billion are direct healthcare costs. In adults with zero minutes of PA, increasing MPA or VPA by 10 minutes/day could prevent 219,412 and 420,180 cases and save R$8.5 and 16.2 billion by 2050, respectively.
In Brazil, one in seven dementia cases is linked to physical inactivity. Modest increases in PA could yield major health and economic benefits.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-4">摘要</h3>
<p>This study investigated the effects of the Flourishing Intervention (FI) versus usual care (UC) on craving symptoms, mental health, and quality of life among hospitalized crack/cocaine users.
A quasi-experimental mixed-methods study was conducted in a Brazilian psychiatric hospital. Participants were inpatients (N=119) undergoing detoxification and met ICD-10 criteria for crack/cocaine use disorders. The FI included twelve meetings (ten group sessions) on virtues and human values. Outcomes included crack/cocaine craving (primary), personal flourishing, depression, anxiety, impulsivity, quality of life, readiness to change, religiosity, and spirituality. Qualitative data were collected via semi-structured interviews.
Post-treatment, the FI group (n=79) had slightly lower scores on the Cocaine Craving Questionnaire-Brief (CCQ) measure (d=-0.21) compared to the UC group (n=40); the difference between the two groups on a visual analog scale (VAS) of crack/cocaine craving (d=-0.03) was more negligible. Within-group analyses for the FI group supported post-intervention improvements in craving (CCQ: d=-0.51; VAS: d=-0.61) and several secondary outcomes. Qualitative findings (n=30) highlighted the value of group therapy, motivation to quit drugs and to reach personal goals, positive emotions, and strengthening protective factors.
This study provided preliminary evidence suggesting that the FI may be beneficial in reducing craving symptoms and promoting personal flourishing.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-5">摘要</h3>
<p>Resettled refugee families face elevated mental health risks, compounded by structural and cultural barriers. The Family Strengthening Intervention for Resettlement (FSIR), co-developed with resettled refugee communities, aims to improve family functioning and child mental health. This study evaluated FSI-R in Somali Bantu and Bhutanese communities in New England during COVID-19 using a Hybrid Type II Implementation-Effectiveness Trial guided by the EPIS framework.
Linear mixed modeling assessed changes in family functioning and child mental health. A process evaluation identified implementation barriers and informed adaptations. Activities were registered under Clinical Registry #NCT03796065.
Bhutanese families receiving FSI-R showed greater improvements in parental supervision compared to usual care. Process evaluation highlighted that responsiveness to community needs supported successful implementation despite pandemic stressors. Somali Bantu interventionists reported stronger emotional connection with families during in-person delivery.
Findings support the utility of hybrid trials in assessing both effectiveness and implementation of preventive interventions with resettling families. Despite contextual disruptions, attention to community needs and delivery flexibility enabled successful implementation. This study underscores the importance of context-informed strategies to sustain core elements of evidence-based interventions in dynamic settings.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-6">摘要</h3>
<p>Tourette syndrome (TS) is often comorbid with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and is associated with inhibitory control deficits. However, the differences in whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) between TS with and without ADHD and their neural basis for inhibitory control remain unclear. This study examines FC differences between these groups and their association with inhibitory control.
We recruited 52 children with TS (30 pure TS, 22 TS+ADHD) from Beijing Children’s Hospital. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to construct individual FC networks, and inhibitory control was assessed using the Go/No-Go task. Group differences in whole-brain FC were analyzed using the network-based statistic (NBS) approach, which identifies connected subnetworks showing significant differences between groups while controlling for multiple comparisons. Multivariate linear regression models examined associations between FC and inhibitory control, adjusting for ADHD comorbidity.
Compared to the pure TS group, the TS+ADHD group showed decreased FC involving the default mode, somatomotor, and limbic networks. In both groups, inhibitory control had a positive correlation with FCs, predominantly involving the default mode, frontoparietal, somatomotor and attention networks. There were no significant group differences in FC related to inhibitory control.
Although differences in FC were observed between the TS and TS+ADHD groups, both groups exhibited similar FC associated with inhibitory control. These findings highlight the neural impact of ADHD in TS and provide insights for future clinical interventions.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-7">摘要</h3>
<p>A rheumatoid arthritis autoimmun eredetű, krónikus, gyulladásos ízületi megbetegedés. A betegség gyakran progresszív, és az ízületi struktúrák károsodásához, mozgáskorlátozottsághoz, munkaképesség-csökkenéshez, valamint életminőség-romláshoz vezethet. Jelentős terhet ró az egyénekre és az egészségügyi rendszerekre egyaránt. A rheumatoid arthritis komplex kezelése gyógyszeres és nem gyógyszeres elemeket is magában foglal. A mozgásterápia mint nem farmakológiai intervenció egyre nagyobb figyelmet kap, különösen a funkcionális állapot, a fájdalomcsillapítás és az életminőség javítása szempontjából, így a betegség kezelésének elengedhetetlen része. Az összefoglaló tanulmány célja annak áttekintése, hogy milyen hatással van a mozgásterápia a rheumatoid arthritises betegek életminőségére, különös tekintettel a fizikai funkciókra, a pszichológiai jóllétre, valamint a mozgásterápia digitális és ergoterápiás lehetőségeire. Az áttekintett evidenciák alapján a személyre szabott gyógytorna rheumatoid arthritis esetén biztonságos, javítja a fizikai funkciókat és az életminőséget, csökkenti a fáradékonyságot, és hozzájárul a gyulladásos aktivitás mérsékléséhez. A gyógytorna mellett a rendszeres, megfelelően tervezett fizikai aktivitás igazoltan kedvező hatással van a szív- és érrendszeri funkciókra. A mozgásterápiát minden esetben a beteg aktuális egészségi állapotához, fizikai kapacitásához és az alapbetegség aktivitásához igazítva kell kialakítani. Orv Hetil. 2025; 166(40): 1574–1581.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-8">摘要</h3>
<p>This study investigated the synergistic effects of chlorine or ozone application to secondary effluent prior to ultraviolet (UV) disinfection on the inactivation of E. coli, total coliforms, Clostridium perfringens, Giardia spp. cysts, and Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts. The physicochemical parameters remained statistically similar in the chlorine assays. In contrast, ozonation reduced the COD, solids, turbidity, and absorbance at 254 nm. The order of microorganism resistance was as follows: E. coli = total coliforms &lt; C. perfringens across all treatments (both individual and sequential). The ozone dosage was more strongly correlated with microbial inactivation than was the applied CT (concentration × contact time), indicating greater efficacy with greater ozone consumption. Chick’s kinetic model provided the best fit for UV radiation, whereas the Hom model was more suitable for chlorination. Standalone ozone treatment notably reduced Giardia cyst concentrations, and standard fluorescence reduction after sequential treatments suggested oxidative damage to cyst walls. The high viability of Cryptosporidium oocysts after disinfection raises significant public health concerns. Synergistic inactivation varied by treatment: ozone-UV (0.02 to 1.28 log) and chlorine-UV (0.07 to 0.82 log), depending on the target organism. These findings indicate that lower CT values for primary disinfectants can effectively reduce pathogen levels, offering a more sustainable approach to wastewater treatment.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-9">摘要</h3>
<p>Az étkezési zavar a mentális betegségek egy csoportja, amely döntően befolyásolja az egyén érzelmi, pszichológiai és fizikai jóllétét; tipikusan nőknél jelentkezik, a leginkább a reproduktív évek alatt. A várandósság alatt a táplálkozási zavar prevalenciája 7,5–11,5%. A várandósok 70–85%-ánál ételaverzió, 100%-ánál émelygés, 40%-ánál pedig fokozott nyáltermelés (ptyalismus) jelentkezik. Nagy kihívást jelent az étkezési zavar várandósság alatti ellátása, hiszen veszélyes állapothoz vezethet, sőt anyai vagy magzati halált is okozhat. Ma már nincs olyan szülész, aki ne találkozna étkezési zavarban szenvedő várandóssal. Ugyanakkor az alap-, illetve a szakképzés során ennek a betegségnek a diagnosztizálásáról, kezeléséről kapott ismeretek minimálisak. A közlemény célja, hogy az irodalomra támaszkodva bemutassa az étkezési zavarok különböző formáit és hatásukat az anyára, a magzatra, a terhesség kimenetelére, a szülés folyamatára, valamint az újszülöttre, továbbá felsorolja a hazánkban elérhető szűrőeszközöket és a várandósgondozást végzők számára értékes, étkezési zavarokra utaló jeleket. Az étkezési zavarban szenvedő várandós kezelése akkor hatékony, ha multidiszciplináris csapat tartja kézben, amelynek tagjai mind az anya, mind a születendő gyermek érdekeit figyelembe veszik. A szerző a közlemény végén javaslatokat fogalmaz meg a gyakorlat számára, és kiemeli, hogy mikor van szükség az étkezési zavarban szenvedő várandós kórházi kezelésére.

<h3 id="摘要-11">摘要</h3>
<p>Eating disorders impact physical, psychological, and social well-being, and often need complex health care. Understanding changes in healthcare utilization is essential for policy and planning. This research evaluates healthcare utilization by people with eating disorders by linking person-level data across health settings to provide a system-wide description of eating disorder care.
This retrospective cohort study evaluates health service use by people with eating disorders aged 6 years or older in the three most populous states in Australia; New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria, for a 10-year period, 2010-2019, by linking data for hospital admissions (public and private), emergency department presentations and public outpatient mental health. Population rates and Average Annual Percent Change (AAPC) by age groups are reported.
Service use increased significantly over the decade in all states, in all healthcare settings, and was highest for young people. Public outpatient service contacts doubled in VIC, almost tripled in NSW, and increased 5-fold in QLD. Public hospital admissions doubled in NSW and VIC and tripled in QLD. Hospital admissions for males increased at a higher rate than for females in NSW and QLD, and public hospital admissions for males in QLD increased 6-fold over the study period. Presentations to emergency departments doubled in all states. Population rates and AAPC show increases were greatest in 16- and 17-year-olds.
This study covering three-quarters of the Australian population demonstrates substantial increases in rates of health service use for people with eating disorders between 2010 and 2019.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-12">摘要</h3>
<p>Restrictive laws still impede nurse practitioners (NPs) from realizing the full scope of their training and education in too many states. While practice laws vary from state to state, working in states with restricted practice policies creates a multitude of barriers for patients seeking accessible, high-quality mental health care, especially in rural areas.
One psychiatric mental health NP describes the multiple obstacles she faced in attempting to provide much-needed care to the perinatal mental health community in her state.
This review highlights evidence that supports full practice authority, showing improved patient access to high-quality care combined with anecdotal support describing the barriers faced by one clinician.
Her journey directly speaks to harsh realities imposed by collaborative physician mandates and the urgent need for nurse practitioner independent practice.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-13">摘要</h3>
<p>Genetic testing in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) in Ontario includes germline next-generation sequencing (NGS) for 19 genes. Additionally, tumor tissue undergoes reflex NGS testing for BRCA1/2 to assess eligibility for PARPi. Although parallel testing confers advantages, this model duplicates healthcare resources. Here, we prospectively assessed the feasibility of tumor-first multigene testing by comparing tumor tissue with germline testing of peripheral blood. An 18-gene NGS panel was used to test tumor and germline DNA (n = 106 patients). In 26 patients, 27 tumor Tier I or II variants were identified, with 16/27 (59%) being germline pathogenic variants (PV) (13 BRCA1/2; 3 other genes) and 11/27 (41%) somatic variants (9 BRCA1/2; 2 other). In 51/106 patients, there were no tumor variants (excluding TP53), of which one patient had a germline BRCA1 copy number variant deletion in exon 12. Tumor-first testing detected variant-positive and variant-negative germline cases in 105/106 patients (99.1%). Among 50 BRCA-negative patients, 14/50 (28%) were homologous recombination deficiency (HRD)-positive. Therefore, we demonstrate that multigene NGS tumor-testing is effective in identifying germline variants in EOC with a &lt; 1% false-negative rate.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-14">摘要</h3>
<p>Poor oral health is a common but often overlooked concern in palliative care, negatively impacting patients’ quality of life. There is limited understanding of how palliative care providers (PCPs) approach oral health promotion in this context. This review synthesises evidence on the knowledge, attitudes and practices of PCPs regarding oral health care and strategies to support them in this area.
Integrative review.
A systematic literature search was undertaken until January 2025 across multiple databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane, ProQuest, EMBASE and Scopus) and grey literature. Inclusion criteria focused on nurses, medical specialists and allied health professionals involved in palliative or end-of-life care, with no publication year restriction.
This review followed Whittemore and Knafl’s (2005) framework for integrative reviews. Study quality was assessed using appropriate tools for qualitative and quantitative studies, clinical guidelines and screening tools. A hybrid thematic synthesis approach was used for analysis.
Twenty-five studies were included, mostly of moderate to high quality. Sample sizes ranged from 8 to 1339, with most participants being nurses and nursing assistants, followed by medical professionals. Findings revealed inconsistent knowledge, varied practices and limited prioritisation of oral health care. Barriers included system constraints, limited training and patient-related challenges. Supportive strategies such as guidelines, screening tools and educational interventions were identified.
A significant gap exists in PCP knowledge and practices regarding oral healthcare due to various barriers, with few supportive strategies documented in this field.
There is an urgent need for enhanced education, robust evidence-based guidelines and tailored training for providers to advance and integrate oral health care in palliative care settings.

<p>Health for Hearts United provides valuable insights into the role of Internal Champions (IC) in promoting health within church-based settings. ICs’ success depends not only on their personal traits and motivation but also on the community support and social networks that academic partners can help facilitate. Our findings suggest that, beyond their traditional roles, academic partners can significantly contribute to program success by providing emotional support, fostering a sense of belonging, and nurturing community relationships. Moving forward, future research should further explore how academic partners can integrate more deeply into community dynamics to promote long-term sustainability and engagement in church-based health interventions.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-16">摘要</h3>
<p>Although caregivers for patients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) experience adverse physical and psychological outcomes, little is known about how these experiences change over time. The aim of this study was to identify trajectories in physical and psychological outcomes in caregivers for adults with ESLD over the course of 12 months.
Informal caregivers (age ≥ 18 years) were recruited from liver clinics within two medical centers. Survey data were collected at baseline and every 3 months for 12 months. Caregivers completed the Multidimensional Caregiver Strain Index, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Patient Health Questionnaire, Mishel Uncertainty in Illness Scale for Family Members, Short Form Health Survey, and Multidimensional Perceived Social Support Scale.
The sample (N = 186, age 56.7 ± 13.2 years) were predominantly female (75.3%) and White (89.2%). Caregiver sleep quality and depressive symptoms did not change, whereas care-related strain (p = 0.001) and uncertainty (p = 0.001) improved significantly over time. Spousal caregivers had significantly worse mental quality of life (QOL) at baseline (p = 0.006) compared to non-spousal caregivers. Spousal caregiver mental QOL improved over time, whereas there was no change in mental QOL of non-spousal caregivers (p = 0.025). Relationship quality and female gender were associated with worsening physical QOL over time (p = 0.011 and p = 0.012, respectively).
To maintain or improve caregivers’ abilities to provide care, healthcare professionals should provide resources to caregivers. Future research should include longitudinal, dyadic studies and focus on interventions for improving caregiver physical and mental QOL.
Advanced liver disease is unique compared to other end-stage medical conditions given the presence of confusion, liver failure, and complications specific to liver failure. The burden of the complex care of patients with advanced liver disease is left to caregivers. Very little is known about how burden and well-being change over time in caregivers for patients with advanced liver disease. Unlike most studies that have focused on spousal caregivers, we were able to describe previously unknown differences between spousal and non-spousal caregivers over the course of 12 months. Compared to non-spousal caregivers, spousal caregivers had worse mental well-being at the study beginning, but their mental well-being improved over time. We found caregivers’ quality of the relationship they had with patients and if they were women to be associated with worsening physical well-being over time. To maintain or improve caregivers’ abilities to provide care to patients with advanced liver disease by preventing decline in their well-being, healthcare professionals should pay attention to needs of caregivers in their clinical practice. More research is needed to address differences in well-being between spousal and non-spousal caregivers and why some outcomes improve or stay the same or get worse over time.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-17">摘要</h3>
<p>Adequate sedation is essential for balloon-assisted enteroscopy (BAE). While propofol sedation using target-controlled infusion (TCI) and bispectral index (BIS) monitoring is considered effective, its safety in older patients undergoing antegrade BAE remains unclear. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of TCI/BIS-guided propofol sedation in older patients.
In this retrospective study, 369 patients who underwent antegrade BAE under propofol sedation between April 2017 and March 2024 were categorized into three age groups: younger (&lt; 50 years, N = 123), middle-aged (50-69 years, N = 121), and older (≥ 70 years, N = 125). Propofol dosage, sedation-related adverse events, and procedural outcomes were compared. Multivariate analysis was compared to identify risk factors for major sedation-related events, including hypoxemia, hypotension, bradycardia.
Older patients required significantly lower target concentrations and total doses of propofol than younger and middle-aged patients (younger: 2.0 µg/mL, middle-aged: 1.6 µg/mL, older: 1.4 µg/mL, P &lt; 0.01; younger: 414 mg, middle-aged: 312 mg, older: 212 mg, P &lt; 0.01). Induction time was significantly longer in younger patients (P &lt; 0.01). Major sedation-related adverse event rates did not significantly differ by age group. Multivariate analysis showed no association between age and adverse events. Low preoperative systolic blood pressure increased the risk of hypotension (OR = 2.32), chronic respiratory disease increased the risk of hypoxemia (OR = 2.97), and ASA class III increased the risk of bradycardia (OR = 3.38). All procedures were completed successfully without severe adverse events.
TCI/BIS-guided propofol sedation may be acceptable for older patients undergoing antegrade BAE, who require a lower propofol dose than younger patients.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-18">摘要</h3>
<p>To explore how older adult-family caregiver dyads jointly manage multiple chronic conditions. Specifically, it investigates how dyads (i) prioritise chronic diseases, (ii) make and negotiate decisions related to self-care and (iii) define and distribute self-care tasks and caregiver contributions.
A qualitative descriptive study using dyadic data collection and analysis.
Semi-structured interviews were conducted separately with chronically ill older adults and their family caregivers between July and December 2024. A hybrid inductive-deductive content analysis was applied. Dyadic analysis compared intra-dyad perspectives to identify patterns of agreement and disagreement.
Thirty-four dyads (n = 68 participants) were interviewed. Older adults had a mean age of 80.09 years (SD = 6.95) and were affected by a median of four chronic conditions. Family caregivers had a mean age of 51.71 years (SD = 14.59), with most being the older adults’ children (66.67%) and women (82.35%). Five categories, comprising 25 subcategories, were derived from the data. Disease prioritisation varied within dyads: older adults often focused on conditions with the most disabling symptoms, while caregivers emphasised those with higher risks of complication. Decision-making roles ranged from older adult-led to caregiver-led to shared. Care organisation followed three models: collaborative, older adult-directed, or caregiver-directed. Challenges in managing diseases included treatment adherence, care coordination, emotional burden and addressing multiple symptoms simultaneously. Role distribution in disease management and decision-making was complex and occasionally misaligned, sometimes resulting in conflict. Collaborative dyads reported greater adaptability and balance, while incongruent dyads experienced relational and organisational strain.
Managing multiple chronic conditions in older adults is a relational process shaped by interpersonal dynamics and shared responsibilities with family caregivers. Recognising dyadic relational patterns is essential for designing targeted educational interventions. Nurses should incorporate dyadic assessments into routine care to improve outcomes for older adults and reduce caregiver burden.
This study highlights the importance of viewing chronic disease management as a dyadic process, rather than an individual task, involving both the older adult and the family caregiver. Tailored strategies that account for the relational dynamics within dyads, such as decision-making roles and care task distribution, are essential for effective chronic disease management.

However, several factors prevent the widespread implementation of this useful tool in clinical practice. We aim to evaluate the perception and current state of genetic testing utilization among pediatric nephrologists.
This study involved a nationwide survey including questions about the availability of genetic testing, perceptions, modalities, indications, and barriers to routine utilization in clinical practice.
Forty pediatric nephrologists completed the survey. Over 60% of respondents reported that genetic testing services were available at their institutions and over 70% reported that whole exome sequencing was the most frequent genetic testing modality. Barriers to genetic testing were mostly financial or due to a lack of awareness among providers. Glomerulopathies, tubulopathies, and ciliopathies were the most common reasons for sending genetic samples.
Despite the availability at most centers, pediatric nephrologists face difficulties in interpreting genetic test results.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-20">摘要</h3>
<p>This work aims to develop an electrochemical sensor by modifying a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) with CuAlO2 nanopowder for the detection of carbendazim (CBZ). The CuAlO2 nanopowder, characterized by its high surface area and porous nature, was synthesized via a highly efficient glycine nitrate self-combustion process (GNP). The structural features of CuAlO2 and the modified electrodes were thoroughly examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and BET surface area analysis. Furthermore, the electrochemical properties of the GCE@CuAlO2 electrode were investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. The modified GCE@CuAlO2 electrode exhibited an enhanced sensor response toward CBZ detection, showing a significantly increased oxidation peak current along with a well-defined peak potential. It demonstrated an excellent electrocatalytic activity toward CBZ sensing, achieving a broad linear detection range (0.01-800 μM), a low detection limit (1 nM), and high sensitivity (1.44 μA μM-1 cm-2). The electrical performance of the GCE@CuAlO2 electrode confirmed its efficient functionality, exhibiting good stability, coherence, and long-term equilibrium. In addition, the modified electrode showed outstanding specificity, selectivity, reproducibility, repeatability, long-term stability, and anti-interference capability for CBZ detection. Furthermore, using DFT calculations, the adsorption of CBZ on the CuAlO2 slab has been investigated, revealing exceptional sensing performance with an adsorption energy of -5.973 eV and strong interaction between CuAlO2 and CBZ, as confirmed by the NCI scatter plot. In conclusion, the GCE@CuAlO2 electrode developed via a cost-effective and straightforward method presents a promising platform for constructing highly efficient electrochemical sensors for CBZ detection at the nanomolar level in various vegetables, fruits, and different water media.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-21">摘要</h3>
<p>Bisphenol A (BPA), a typical endocrine-disrupting chemical, occurs in food samples due to its release from food packaging materials, posing a great exposure threat to human health. Selective and sensitive determination of released BPA from packaging materials is of great importance. Herein, we report a persistent luminescence aptasensor for the autofluorescence-free determination of released BPA from packaging materials with high selectivity and sensitivity. The proposed aptasensor was composed of BPA aptamer-functionalized Fe3O4 nanoparticles as the recognition and separation unit and complementary DNA (cDNA)-decorated ZnGeO4:Mn2+ (ZGM) as the persistent luminescence source. The developed aptasensor combined the merits of the autofluorescence-free determination from ZGM, high selectivity from the aptamer, and rapid separation from magnetic Fe3O4. The proposed aptasensor gave a wide linear range from 1 ng L-1 to 100 μg L-1 and a low detection limit of 0.036 ng L-1. The precision for the determination of 1 μg L-1 BPA was 5.0% (RSD, n = 11). The proposed aptasensor was applied for the determination of released BPA from food packaging materials. The results showed that photoaging and heating significantly increased the release of BPA from packaging materials to water, posing a significant toxicity risk to humans. The proposed aptasensor has potential extension in analyzing other kinds of analytes by simply replacing the aptamer and cDNA, providing a highly sensitive and selective autofluorescence-free platform for sensing hazardous analytes.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-22">摘要</h3>
<p>This study aims to elucidate the potential mechanism of cardiotoxicity induced by nonylphenol (NP) through network toxicology, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation. With the help of Swisstarget prediction, the comparative toxicology database and genecards database, 197 genes related to NP-induced cardiac toxicity were identified as Potential target. Using the STRING database and cytoscape 3.10.1 software, 8 core targets (such as AKT1, MAPK3, STAT3) were further screened. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses showed that NP mainly affects PI3K-Akt, MAPK and JAK-STAT pathways, regulating cell apoptosis and inflammation. Molecular docking demonstrated that NP stably binds to the core target, and molecular dynamics simulations further verified the stability of the NP-MAPK3 complex, with a binding free energy of -1.215 kcal/mol, and the system exhibits good stability. In conclusion, NP may induce cardiotoxicity by interfering with PI3K-Akt, MAPK and other signaling pathways. This research provides a multi-dimensional methodological framework for analyzing the toxic mechanism of environmental pollutants, and lays the theoretical foundation for risk assessment and prevention strategies.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-23">摘要</h3>
<p>Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) is attracting attention as a new neuromodulation technique to improve cognitive function. The effects of this neuromodulation technique on associative memory and its mechanisms have not been fully investigated. This crossover, single-blind, active-versus-sham design experiment examined the effects of taVNS on associative memory performance and the event-related potential P300 or P600. The experiment consisted of an associative memory task with encoding and retrieval as a set, performed three timepoints with a 10 min rest period, on 14 healthy adults. Participants received taVNS or sham during the 10 min rest between the time 1 and time 2. Event-related potentials were measured at each time of the associative memory task. The washout for this experiment was set at one week. We analyzed the effects of taVNS by means of a general linear mixed model with performance on three associative memory tasks and peak amplitude of event-related potential P300 or P600 as dependent variables. The results presented an interaction effect of taVNS and timepoints on associative memory performance. Conversely, no effects on the event-related potentials P300 and P600 were observed. This noninvasive neuromodulation technique holds potential for applications in rehabilitation for cognitive function. Further research is needed to generalize the results of this pilot study.

<h3 id="摘要-24">摘要</h3>
<p>The CCM-ITALUNG2 pilot was implemented to evaluate the feasibility of an organized lung cancer (LC) screening programme in five Italian centres.
The screening pathway included invitation, recruitment, referral to Smoking Cessation Services (SCSs), and use of the Lung-RADS score for low-dose CT reading. Dedicated screening operators followed up participants from recruitment through the clinical follow-up established by multidisciplinary teams. Eligibility criteria included age 55-75 years, ever-smokers with ≥ 25 pack-years; quit within the past 10 years. Baseline round results are presented.
From November 2022 to May 2024, 1,144 of the 1,971 invited individuals (58.0%) were recruited following different strategies including in-person invitation by general practitioners (GPs; 356 subjects, 31.9%) or other healthcare personnel (18.1%), self-presentation (36.3%), and phone invitation using GPs’ patient lists (13.7%). Among current smokers, 38.5% accepted referral to SCSs. Eighteen subjects (77.8% in stage I-II) were diagnosed with LC (prevalent LC rate 1.57%). The mean time to surgery was 147 days (standard deviation 73); the false-positive rate was 1.38% (15/1,085).
By utilizing different organizational models, the pilot was tailored to the specific characteristics of each centre. Phone invitations from GPs’ patient lists, in-person invitations by GPs and other healthcare personnel, and self-presentation might enhance equity of access in comparison with self-referral only. Dedicated screening operators, the use of the Lung-RADS scoring system, and a structured clinical follow-up supported participants throughout the screening pathway. Delivering brief advice for smoking cessation during recruitment and offering SCS referral were feasible within the screening pathway.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-25">摘要</h3>
<p>Sacituzumab govitecan (SG) is approved for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer in ≥ 2 line setting at 10 mg/kg IV on Days 1 and 8 (21-day cycle). Trials confirmed its superiority over 8 mg/kg with manageable safety. In practice, precautionary dose reductions are used despite no formal guidance. In Poland, fixed 200 mg vials and unreimbursed drug waste lead to early dose adjustments.
This retrospective study evaluated the impact of initial SG dose reduction on treatment outcomes and tolerability in Polish patients. Medical records provided data on baseline features, treatment, survival, and safety. Kaplan-Meier and chi-square tests were used for survival and group comparisons. A multivariate Cox model assessed the independent effect of dose reduction on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Significance was set at p &lt; 0.05.
Among 83 patients (median age 55, range 30-86), initial dose reductions ≥ 10% were observed in 16 patients (19.3%), including 9 (10.8%) with dose reduced ≥ 20%. Administrative adjustments (reductions &gt; 10% to flat doses of 200 mg multiplications) accounted for 18.1% of the entire cohort. Grade ≥ 2 and ≥ 3 adverse events occurred in 83.1% and 56.6%, respectively. In a multivariate analysis, a ≥ 20% initial dose reduction remained an independent predictor of shorter PFS (HR: 2.6; 95% CI: 1.1-6.6; p = 0.04) and OS (HR: 6; 95% CI: 2-17.5; p = 0.001). Initial dose reduction did not affect toxicity.
In this preliminary report initial dose reduction of SG negatively impacted PFS and OS without reducing toxicity, highlighting the need for further studies and dosing policy adjustments.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-26">摘要</h3>
<p>Belumosudil is approved after failure of ≥2 lines of therapy in chronic graft-versus-host disease cGVHD. However, real-world data is limited. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 67 patients with steroid-refractory or dependent (SR/SD) cGVHD. At baseline, most patients had advanced multi-organ cGVHD. The 6- and 12-month overall response rate (ORR) was 61%. However, a subset of patients achieved deeper responses with ongoing therapy at 12 months. The 6-month failure-free survival (FFS) was 75% (95%CI: 65-86) whereas the 12-month FFS was 66% (95%CI: 55-78). A low incidence of drug-related grade ≥3 toxicities was observed. A cohort of patients with immune function analysis showed gradual improvement in immune subsets at 1-year post-treatment. The combined bel-rux cohort (n = 14) showed a 6- and 12-month ORR of 64% and 57%, respectively. Overall, belumosudil was associated with high treatment response and survival outcomes. Notably, deeper responses were observed with ongoing therapy, and it was overall well tolerated. In a cohort of patients, immune cell populations had preserved to improved values throughout treatment. Patients who received bel-rux demonstrated efficacy and safety as well. Overall, our real-world study indicates similar findings to the clinical trial and supports the use of belumosudil in cGVHD.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-27">摘要</h3>
<p>Oral health is a neglected aspect of healthcare, especially among prison inmates who face barriers in accessing dental services. Dental caries is a prevalent and preventable disease that affects inmates’ general health and quality of life. This study evaluated dental caries and its predictors among inmates in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia.
This cross-sectional study was conducted as part of an ongoing oral health program by the College of Dentistry, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University(IAU), Dammam, targeting inmates in prisons across Dammam, Khobar, Dhahran, Jubail, and AlHasa in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. This prison outreach program is conducted annually from January to April. Male and female inmates who voluntarily consented were included without exclusion criteria. Data collection involved oral examinations using the DMFT index and Simplified Oral Hygiene Index (OHI-S), following World Health Organization’s (WHO) criteria, and structured interviews based on the WHO Oral Health Questionnaire for Adults. Calibrated examiners performed the examinations using portable dental units. Statistical analysis included t-tests, ANOVA, Pearson correlation, and multiple linear regression analysis.
The sample consisted of 230 participants with 86.1% males and 13.9% females. In the study, 98.3% of the sample had untreated decay and 99.1% of participants had DMFT score ranging from 1 to 28, with a mean score of 14.41 ± 7.89. About 25.2% of participants never cleaned their teeth using any tool, 23.5% did not use toothpaste, and 23.5% consumed soft drinks several times a day. Dental attendance, defined as being seen by a dentist at prison, within the last year was reported by 37% of participants and 15.2% never received dental care. Most participants (85.2%) reported dental pain during the last year. The study showed a statistically significant correlation between the simplified oral hygiene index and the mean decayed score (r = 0.456, P &lt; 0.001). The mean DMFT of the sample significantly increased with advancing age (P = 0.023). Male participants (15.12 ± 7.94) demonstrated significantly higher mean DMFT score than females (10.03 ± 6.05) (P = 0.001). Similarly, significantly higher DMFT was found in Saudi (15.74 ± 7.91) versus non-Saudi participants (10.45 ± 6.41) (P &lt; 0.001). Those who used toothpaste (12.82 ± 6.95) had significantly lower mean DMFT score than those who did not use toothpaste (19.59 ± 8.58) (P = 0.006). A statistically significant relationship was observed between soft drink consumption and caries experience (P = 0.043).
Untreated decay was highly prevalent among inmates in this study. A statistically significant correlation was found between oral hygiene and caries experience, with advancing age, male gender, Saudi nationality, and frequent soft drink consumption being significantly associated with higher caries levels. These findings highlight the urgent need for targeted oral health promotion strategies and improved access to dental care within correctional facilities. Policy implications include the integration of oral health education into prison health programs and the establishment of routine dental screenings. Future research should explore the effectiveness of mobile dental services and behavioral interventions tailored to this high-risk population.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-28">摘要</h3>
<p>Microplastics (MPs) pollution is a significant environmental problem of increasing potential consequences for ecosystem health. The present work represents the first study to evaluate the occurrence of MPs particles on Syrian beaches, covering four coastal locations namely, Tartous (Golden sand and Albasira), Lattakia (Blue coast), and Baniyas (Musfat Baniyas). MPs were extracted from sand using density separation (NaCl, 1.2 g mL-1) and enzymatic digestion (Protease) was carried out to ensure that MPs were free of organic materials. Fluorescence microscopy with Nile Red staining was used to detect and count MPs, while attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to identify their polymer types and compositions as well as their surface morphology. The total MPs concentrations in the four different locations varied from 0.22 ± 0.12 to 17.8 ± 5.0 items kg-1 of dry sand with sizes classified into 0.3-1 mm and 1-5 mm fractions. Low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP), and oxidized polyethylene were identified as the main constituents of the MPs samples. The findings reveal that Syrian beaches are already affected by MPs contamination, with variation linked to local human activity. Given the dependence of Syrian coastal communities on fisheries, tourism, and industrial activities, these results underline the urgent need for national monitoring programs, improved waste management policies, and regional cooperation in the Eastern Mediterranean. This baseline study therefore provides critical scientific evidence to support both environmental policy and future research on marine pollution in Syria.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-29">摘要</h3>
<p>Dietary fatty acids are involved in the pathogenesis of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). We examined the mechanism by which dietary fatty acid composition affects MASLD pathogenesis.
The MASLD mouse model was developed by feeding a high-fat diet (HFD) rich in palmitic acid (PA), trans-fatty acids (TFAs), or oleic acid (OA). For in vitro experiments, Hepa 1-6 cells were exposed to PA, elaidic acid (a representative TFA), and OA. Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 1 (GPAM) expression in Hepa 1-6 cells was manipulated using a plasmid encoding GPAM and GPAM-specific siRNAs. In addition, GPAM depletion in the liver of HFD-fed mice was achieved using a pH-sensitive multifunctional envelope-type nanodevice as a siRNA carrier. Liver specimens from patients with MASLD were also analyzed.
The TFA group displayed higher serum alanine-aminotransferase and hepatic triglyceride content but lower serum fasting triglyceride and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) compared with that in the PA and OA groups. Hepatic GPAM expression in the TFA group was higher than in the PA group. Consistently, TFA-treated Hepa 1-6 cells showed a greater GPAM increase than that with OA and PA. GPAM-overexpressing Hepa 1-6 cells showed increased triglyceride accumulation, whereas GPAM-deficient cells failed to accumulate triglyceride. Hepatic GPAM knockdown in HFD-fed mice suppressed steatosis and increased VAT. Notably, hepatic GPAM gene expression was higher in patients with severe steatosis than in those with non-severe steatosis.
A TFA-rich HFD increased hepatic GPAM expression, exacerbated steatosis, and decreased VAT. Therefore, GPAM may regulate systemic fat accumulation in the body.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-30">摘要</h3>
<p>To determine the most effective diagnostic imaging modality including computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT), and ultrasound (US) for the identification of regional lymph node involvement in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).
A search was performed to identify qualified studies using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science electronic databases from January 2013 to December 2023. The outcome assessed was the diagnostic performance of different imaging techniques in the detection of cervical lymph node metastasis in OSCC, with lymph node yield in neck dissection specimens as the gold standard for validation. Summary estimates for diagnostic performance were sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Differences in sensitivities, specificities, and DOR were tested using a bivariate random effects model.
Twelve observational studies including PET/CT, MRI, and CT alone or combined in OSCC patients were included in the meta-analysis. Data from a single study based on US were insufficient to assess the value of this imaging modality. The pooled estimates of sensitivity were 0.87 for PET/CT, 0.70 for MRI, and 0.66 for CT. The corresponding pooled specificities were 0.79, 0.79, and 0.81, respectively. The DOR was 24.85 for PET/CT, 8.60 for MRI, and 8.59 for CT.
PET/CT may be recommended in clinical practice for detecting cervical metastatic disease in OSCC patients as this technique showed the most favorable diagnostic performance as compared with MRI and CT.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-31">摘要</h3>
<p>The molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) was synthesized using the bulk polymerization technique and characterized by Scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller/Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BET/BJH), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), and point of zero charge (pHPZC) analyses. The adsorption of sulfasalazine (SSZ) onto the MIP was systematically investigated under various conditions. The researchers investigated the effect of initial SSZ concentration, MIP mass, temperature, pH, and contact time. The highest removal efficiency was achieved at pH 7, MIP dosage of 0.8 g/L, and an initial SSZ concentration of 10 mg/L, with an equilibrium contact time of 75 min. The maximum adsorption capacities obtained from the Langmuir model were 217.1, 235.4, 254.3, and 284.5 mg/g at 20, 30, 40, and 50 °C, respectively, confirming a monolayer adsorption process. Kinetic analysis indicated that the adsorption followed the pseudo-second-order model (R2 &gt; 0.995), while thermodynamic studies revealed that the process was spontaneous (ΔG° = -3.41 to -8.95 kJ/mol) and endothermic (ΔH° = 38.4 kJ/mol). The MIP maintained over 93% of its initial adsorption capacity after five regeneration cycles. Competitive adsorption tests further demonstrated a significantly higher affinity of the MIP for SSZ compared with ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin. These results suggest that the synthesized MIP is a highly efficient, selective, and reusable adsorbent for removing SSZ from aqueous environments.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-32">摘要</h3>
<p>Complement Factor H (CFH) is a crucial regulator of the alternative complement pathway, maintaining immune balance by preventing excessive activation that damages host tissues. This liver-derived glycoprotein binds to C3b and inhibits C3 convertase formation, with its N-terminal (CCP1-4) and C-terminal (CCP19-20) domains playing key roles in complement regulation and host recognition. In this in silico study, we explored the molecular architecture and interaction landscape of Factor H, identifying highly conserved motifs-particularly in CCP4, CCP8-9, and CCP12, as well as conserved lysine residues across CCP1-4. Motifs 11, 14, and 18 were mapped to the C-terminal domains (CCP18-20). Ligand interaction analysis revealed that heparin binds to CCP2 and CCP15, malondialdehyde binds to CCP3, N-glycoloyl-D-glucosamine to CCP11, and O-sialic acid to CCP11 and CCP12. Additionally, FH was shown to interact with endogenous ligands, including PTX3, fibromodulin, osteoadherin, chondroadherin, prion protein, adrenomedullin, and annexin II. These findings provide deeper insight into FH’s role in complement-related disorders, such as aHUS, AMD, and dense deposit disease, supporting its potential as a therapeutic target for precision immune modulation.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-33">摘要</h3>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS), is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by neuroinflammation and demyelination, with no known cure. Previous studies demonstrated that crotoxin, a neurotoxin derived from rattlesnake venom, effectively alleviated hyperalgesia and clinical symptoms in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) when combined with silica SBA-15 (CTX-SBA-15), an inert nanostructured particle. This combination inhibited disease progression and reduced neuroinflammation. Building on these findings, we conducted a comprehensive gene expression analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and pathways affected by MOG35-55-induced EAE and modulated by CTX, which could serve as potential targets for disease control. Gene expression in the central nervous system was analyzed using the GeneChip platform. Data were processed using the Transcriptome Analysis Console and the Gene Ontology database. The analysis identified 1055 DEGs, with 238 genes specifically associated with the disease in the EAE vs. CFA comparison. In the CTX-SBA-15 post-treatment group, 695 DEGs were identified, with 204 genes upregulated and 491 downregulated compared to the EAE group. Overrepresentation analysis highlighted acetylcholine receptors pathways as significant targets. For validation, donepezil hydrochloride, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, was administered (2 mg/kg/day) initiating 12 days after immunization, with body weight monitored every other day. Donepezil improved clinical symptoms, reduced weight loss, decreased cellular infiltrates, and prevented spinal cord demyelination. In conclusion, our findings highlights that the acetylcholine pathway represents a promising target to be modulated for MS management.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-34">摘要</h3>
<p>We investigated the roles of Rac guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (Rac-GEF) P-Rex1 in glucose homeostasis using Prex1-/- and catalytically inactive Prex1GD mice. P-Rex1 maintains fasting blood glucose levels and insulin sensitivity through its Rac-GEF activity but limits glucose clearance independently of its catalytic activity, throughout aging. Prex1-/- mice on a high-fat diet are protected from diabetes. The increased glucose clearance in Prex1-/- mice may stem in part from constitutively enhanced hepatic glucose uptake. P-Rex1 controls Glut2 surface levels and mitochondrial morphology, membrane potential, and ATP production in hepatocytes, independently of its catalytic activity. The inverse agonist GRA2 showed that P-Rex1 suppresses glucose uptake and mitochondrial ATP production in hepatocytes through the orphan GPCR Gpr21. Cell fractionation showed that P-Rex1 controls Gpr21 trafficking, independently of its catalytic activity. We propose that P-Rex1 limits hepatocyte glucose uptake by retaining Gpr21 at the plasma membrane. These findings delineate new strategies for controlling glucose homeostasis.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-35">摘要</h3>
<p>Asian sand dust (ASD), a type of fine particulate matter originating from arid regions of East Asia, is known to exacerbate respiratory diseases, but its impact on the ocular surface remains poorly understood. Given the increasing prevalence of allergic conjunctivitis in Japan, particularly during the Japanese cedar pollen (JCP) season, we investigated whether ASD exposure aggravates ocular allergic inflammation. Using a mouse model sensitized with JCP, we found that conjunctival instillation of ASD in combination with JCP significantly increased clinical signs such as hyperemia and edema, along with elevated serum IgE levels and enhanced inflammatory cell infiltration compared to JCP alone. Histological analysis revealed epithelial disruption and increased infiltration of CD3-positive T cells and F4/80-positive macrophages in the ASD/JCP group. These findings demonstrate that ASD exacerbates allergic conjunctivitis by amplifying inflammatory responses on the ocular surface. Our study highlights ASD as a potential environmental risk factor for allergic eye diseases and offers novel mechanistic insights into how airborne pollutants interact with allergen-induced ocular inflammation.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-36">摘要</h3>
<p>In an array to check microbial resistance against generally used antibiotics, it is essential to create innovative and efficient antimicrobial agents. Therefore, nanoparticles (NPs) with their antimicrobial activities describe an effective solution. In this study, we synthesized Selenium nanoparticles (Se-NPs) and zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) using Alternaria alternata fungus, then their characterization were evaluated using several techniques.
We explored the potential of antimicrobial impact of Se-NPs and ZnO-NPs against negative and positive grams antibiotic resistance bacterial strains in combination with penicillin, Ceftriaxone and Cefipime. Moreover, antibiotic resistance gene expression was assessed after those treatments. The results demonstrated that Se-NPs and ZnO-NPs displayed antibacterial properties, while the expression of antibiotic resistance genes decreased when exposed to a combination of NPs and antibiotics. This suggests the presence of both synergistic and additive effects in these treatments. Furthermore, the cytotoxic effects of Se-NPs and ZnO-NPs were assessed, revealing their potent anticancer properties against MCF-7, A549, and HepG2 cancer cells and lower cytotoxic values for HFB-4 standard cell line. Ultimately, the production efficiency of both NPs was enhanced through gamma irradiation.
According to the results, it seems that the green synthesis of Se-NPs and ZnO-NPs promotes environmental sustainability and cost-effective approach. This study provides insights into the development of new antibacterial and anticancer agents . The eco-friendly production of nanoparticles suggests also a sustainable approach to combating bacteria resistant to antibiotics.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-37">摘要</h3>
<p>In South America, the rise in chronic respiratory diseases and weight-related issues due to the ongoing epidemiological transition has prompted research into their interrelationship.
We sought to assess the association between body mass index (BMI) and bronchodilator responsiveness (BDR) among adults in Peru, Chile, Uruguay, and Argentina, using population-based data from two cohort studies. We defined BDR as a ≥12% and ≥200 mL increase in either forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) or forced vital capacity (FVC) after administration of a short-acting bronchodilator. The analysis also distinguished between FEV₁- and FVC-specific BDR. We used logistic regression adjusted for confounders to evaluate associations with BMI.
Among 7,160 participants (55.2% men, mean age 57.3 years), 23.7% had a BMI &lt;25 kg/m² and 35.5% had a BMI ≥30 kg/m². Overall, 9.5% met the criteria for BDR; with 7.8% showing FEV1-specific and 4.9% FVC-specific responses. Compared to a BMI of 20-24.9 kg/m², a BMI ≥30 kg/m² was associated with higher odds of FVC-specific BDR (adjusted OR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.08-2.03), whereas a BMI &lt;20 kg/m² was associated with FEV₁-specific BDR among participants with asthma (6.34, 1.16-35.1) and chronic bronchitis (4.71, 1.28-15.9), and with higher odds of any BDR in those with chronic bronchitis (3.90, 1.19-11.93).
There was a differential relationship between BMI and types of BDR: higher BMI was associated with FVC-specific responsiveness, whereas lower BMI was linked to FEV₁-specific BDR in individuals with asthma and chronic bronchitis and to overall BDR in those with chronic bronchitis.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-38">摘要</h3>
<p>Patients with advanced cancer are often confronted with existential distress that, when unaddressed, may lead to increased suffering and despair. Homebound individuals face compounded existential concerns and loss of meaning, as they must contend with loss of independence and declining opportunities for activities and social engagement. Thus, there is a need to develop strategies for delivering quality psychological interventions to homebound patients. In the United States, homecare agencies provide care to over 4.5 million patients annually, with nurses comprising over half of their employees. Given the size of this workforce and their frequent contact with homebound patients, we developed Meaning Centered Psychotherapy at Home (MCP-H) to be delivered by nurses to increase the reach of this evidence-based intervention to this population.
In Phase 1, nurse participants (n = 8-10) from VNS Health will be trained to deliver MCP-H. We will enroll 8-10 training case patients, each paired with one nurse interventionist, in a single-arm open pilot study to refine the intervention structure and procedures. In Phase 2, we will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of MCP-H. Patients (n = 70) will be randomized to receive either MCP-H or treatment as usual.
MCP-H has unique potential to increase the reach of mental health care to individuals receiving homecare, leveraging the existing infrastructure of a high-volume home health agency and nurses to address the unmet needs of these patients. If effective, it can be embedded in existing systems as a potentially widely disseminable approach to reaching historically underserved patient populations.

<h3 id="摘要-39">摘要</h3>
<p>Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a leading cause of biofilm-associated periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs), in part due to its ability to induce an immunosuppressive environment. Biofilm formation promotes the expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and M2 macrophages, which impair host immune responses and facilitate infection persistence. Targeting these immunosuppressive cells offers a promising therapeutic strategy for treating S. aureus biofilm-associated PJIs. Neddylation, a post-translational modification involving the conjugation of the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 to target proteins, regulates various cellular processes and may influence immune cell function during infection. Here, we investigated the role of neddylation in S. aureus biofilm-induced immunosuppression. We found that TAS4464, a selective neddylation inhibitor, markedly suppressed the expansion of MDSCs and M2 macrophages in bone marrow cells (BMCs) stimulated by S. aureus biofilm. TAS4464 also reduced the expression of inflammation-associated cytokines in these cells. Mechanistically, S. aureus biofilm upregulated key components of the neddylation pathway and markers of MDSCs and M2 macrophages in a dose-dependent manner; however, this upregulation is effectively counteracted by TAS4464. Furthermore, in a mouse model of PJI, TAS4464 treatment significantly reduced bone destruction and inflammation, which correlates with the inhibition of the neddylation pathway and a decrease in circulating MDSCs and M2 macrophages. These findings suggest that TAS4464 mitigates S. aureus biofilm-associated PJIs by disrupting the immunosuppressive microenvironment and highlight neddylation as a potential therapeutic target.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-41">摘要</h3>
<p>Fitness instructors (FIs) are professional voice users of the instructor type. They are required to use their voices to coach, motivate, and acknowledge the clientele while leading their classes or sessions. FIs are expected to recruit and retain clients to their sessions, and in order to do so, create themselves as a brand within the marketplace. FIs are at increased risk of developing dysphonia, yet few of them report concerns about this occupational risk factor. In order to devise risk mitigation plans and policies, it is essential to understand how these professionals use their voices in the workplace. This study aimed to explore the phenomenology of occupational voice use in FIs.
A semistructured interview was used to explore the thoughts, attitudes, and beliefs toward occupational voice use in seven FIs. A thematic approach was applied to analyzing the data.
Four major themes emerged from the data: voice as a marker of professional identity, industrial and organizational issues, knowledge of voice and voice use at work, and scientific thinking within the profession.
FIs relied on their voices in numerous ways: to coach their clients, but also to recruit and retain them, to motivate them, and to encourage them on their fitness journeys. Voice was considered to be an integral part of the work identity of FIs in this study. Participants focused largely on the need to project their voices to be understood by clients in different instructing scenarios, yet, alternative ways of using voice to achieve these ends were discussed. FIs could be considered a unique type of professional voice user, in that as well as instruction, there is a performance aspect to their work, as they seek to both teach and entertain, their clientele.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-42">摘要</h3>
<p>A reduction in an aging individual’s abilities combined with environmental changes can lead to decline in everyday function. This study examined the association between visual and cognitive abilities with everyday function and assessed whether measures of Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) moderate the associations of these predictors with activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs).
Using a generalized linear mixed model, the longitudinal associations between changes in vision, cognitive function, and everyday functioning were examined.
Decline in reasoning abilities was associated with more ADL limitations, and the association was stronger for older adults with decreased healthcare access and lower economic stability. Furthermore, the associations between memory and speed of processing were associated with more ADL limitations, and the associations were stronger for older adults with lower educational and occupational status. Also, better memory was associated with fewer IADL limitations, and this association was weaker for older adults with higher educational and occupational status, and social and community contexts.
Interventions to enhance cognitive abilities and modify environmental resources are essential to alleviate IADL/ADL limitations in older age.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-43">摘要</h3>
<p>Workers are exposed to hazardous chemicals from e-waste recycling. Protective measures such as respiratory protective equipment (RPE) and hand hygiene may reduce chemical exposure, but their effectiveness in the e-waste recycling industry remains underexplored. Therefore, a cross-sectional study was conducted from June 2021 to September 2022 involving 101 e-waste workers in Hong Kong during the COVID-19 pandemic to fill such research gap. Participants reported changes in RPE-wearing time and hand-washing frequency compared to pre-pandemic levels. First-spot morning urine samples were collected and analyzed for metals and organic pollutants. Associations between increased protective behaviors and urinary chemical concentrations were assessed using multivariate log-link linear regression models. The results showed that 31.7 % of workers increased RPE use (54.4 % of them wearing medical masks) and 49.5 % increased hand-washing frequency during the pandemic compared with pre-pandemic levels. Increased RPE use was associated with significantly lower urinary concentrations of nine chemicals. Increased hand-washing frequency showed even greater associations with diminished levels of 14 pollutants. Workers who increased both protective behaviors exhibited the greatest decreases in chemical burden. These associations were more pronounced among workers involved in dismantling/repairing e-waste and those employed by non-subsidized entities. In conclusion, enhanced preventive behaviors (RPE use and hand-washing frequency) are significantly associated with decreased chemical exposure levels among e-waste workers in Hong Kong. While engineering controls remain essential, these simple and cost-effective measures provide practical improvements in occupational safety and health, particularly for resource-limited settings where workers face elevated exposure risks due to primitive recycling practices in both developed and developing regions.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-44">摘要</h3>
<p>Cognition is the most commonly used EQ-5D bolt-on, with many different versions varying by descriptors and response levels (3L vs. 5L). We aimed to systematically review the psychometric properties of cognition bolt-ons for the EQ-5D-3L and EQ-5D-5L.
A systematic review was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar following PRISMA 2020 guidelines (PROSPERO:CRD42023445567). We assessed the bolt-ons’ performance both as individual items and when added to the EQ-5D. Each bolt-on version was rated as positive (+) or non-positive (-) within each publication using a checklist, and scores were summed across publications to reflect overall performance.
In total, 101 publications from 72 studies met the inclusion criteria, examining 15 three-level and 13 five-level bolt-ons. The most frequently reported psychometric properties were item-level ceiling (n=75) and known-groups validity (n=54). Fewer studies explored convergent or divergent validity (n=8 for each), responsiveness (n=3), patient-proxy agreement (n=2) and test-retest reliability (n=1). None reported on content validity. Five-level bolt-ons outperformed three-level bolt-ons in terms of overall performance (3L: 55+/57-; 5L: 45+/28-). Supportive psychometric evidence varied by populations, e.g. head/brain injury (3L: 11+/11-; 5L: 1+/3-) and dementia (3L: 9+/8-; 5L: 4+/4-). The most-tested bolt-ons were the Janssen 2013 (5L, cognition: 18+/15-) and Haagsma 2005 (3L, thinking ability: 8+/12-) versions, with fewer than 10 assessments for all other bolt-ons.
Despite several publications, the psychometric evidence remains insufficient to identify a preferred cognition descriptor. Future research should prioritise content validity testing to inform the selection of candidate items, with quantitative psychometric evaluation preferably conducted afterward.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-45">摘要</h3>
<p>Database studies have identified population-level differences in neurosurgical-oncological outcomes. This study aimed to clarify these distinctions by evaluating associations between patient sociodemographics and metrics of care access, utilization, and clinical outcomes.
We retrospectively reviewed a prospectively-identified database of neurosurgical-oncology patients (n=1476) over 5 years. We conducted pathology-specific, multivariate analyses to identify sociodemographics associated with access, utilization, and outcomes; then interviewed (n=40) with newly diagnosed patients.
Significant associations were found between sociodemographics (White n=911; Hispanic/Latino n=285; Asian n=206; Black n=74), sex (ANOVA p=.0043), age (p&lt;.001), income (p&lt;.001), primary language (p&lt;.001), and insurance (p&lt;.001). Emergent presentation and time from imaging to neurosurgical consultation were associated with English as an additional language (EAL) (p=.03, p=.03) and public insurance (p=.003, p=.003). Black patients had increased time from consultation to surgery (p=.011). White patients were less likely to undergo biopsy versus resection (p=.05). EAL was negatively associated with gross total resection (p=.009). Chemotherapy was negatively associated with EAL (p=.02), Black race (p=.005), and public insurance (p=.001). Radiotherapy was negatively associated with EAL (p=.04), public insurance (p=.001), and age (p=.04). Clinical outcomes did not vary by sociodemographics. Interviews identified health literacy, prior healthcare experiences, and patient-surgeon connection as strongest drivers of utilization.
Demographic factors independently associate with healthcare access but not outcomes. Progression through recommended neurosurgical-oncological care is influenced by patient-neurosurgeon relationship and trust in healthcare systems.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-46">摘要</h3>
<p>This paper summarizes the composition and content of antioxidant phytochemicals in 13 common vegetable oils based on previous studies. These phytochemicals influence both the oxidative stability of vegetable oils and human health. The effects of origin, processing, and refining technologies on the antioxidant phytochemicals in vegetable oils are analyzed in detail. Additionally, the antioxidant activity, underlying mechanisms, and contributions of these phytochemicals to oil stability are discussed. It is suggested that selecting oil crop varieties rich in antioxidant phytochemicals can facilitate the development of geographical indication edible oils. Furthermore, four key oil processing technologies are identified to significantly enhance the content of antioxidant phytochemicals in vegetable oils. The refining stages that result in the greatest loss of each antioxidant phytochemical are also identified, and strategies to minimize these losses are proposed. This paper provides theoretical support for the production of vegetable oils with enhanced antioxidant phytochemicals, improved nutritional value, and greater oxidative stability for the oil industry.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-47">摘要</h3>
<p>Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a last resort treatment for children with cardio-respiratory failure. Some of these patients will develop thrombocytopenia-associated multiple organ failure (TAMOF), which is sometimes managed with therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE). Our objective is to describe critically ill children on ECMO who underwent TPE for TAMOF. We conducted a single-center retrospective case series of seven children with congenital cardiac disease, requiring ECMO, diagnosed with TAMOF, and treated with TPE between 12/2023 and 6/2024. A centrifugation-based apheresis instrument was used to process 1.5 total blood volume. One packed red blood cell was used to prime the apheresis circuit. Systemic bivalirudin was used for anticoagulation. Seven patients (median age: 55 days, median weight: 4.0 kg, median bypass time: 172 min, 100% VA ECMO, 85% central cannulation, 100% bivalirudin) underwent a total of 30 TPE sessions. The median number of sessions per patient was 3, with a median time to first session of 27.3 h after cannulation. Plasma was used as the replacement fluid in all sessions, with a median volume of 168 mL/kg. The median platelet count increased from 45 × 109/L (38; 54) pre-TPE to 64 (IQR: 45; 75, p &lt; 0.001) post-TPE, despite no platelet transfusions during TPE. The modified organ severity index decreased significantly from 13 to 12 (p &lt; 0.001). The mortality rate was 71%. TPE may improve platelet counts and reduce organ severity scores in critically ill children with TAMOF on ECMO.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-49">摘要</h3>
<p>Acinic cell carcinoma (ACC) of the breast is a very rare, primary salivary gland-type breast malignancy, with ~100 reported cases in the literature. Limited information about the clinical features and outcomes of patients with ACC is available.
We utilized the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to identify ACC patients. For comparison, we also examined a cohort of invasive breast carcinomas of no special type (NST).
Thirty ACC patients were identified among the more than 248 000 invasive breast carcinoma NST patients. ACCs were predominantly grade 3 carcinomas (44%) and were diagnosed at an earlier stage (67%). Hormone receptor (HR) and HER2 status data were available for only 13 patients, revealing molecular heterogeneity: HR-/HER2- (four patients), HR-/HER2+ (two patients), HR+/HER2- (four patients), and HR+/HER2+ (three patients). The median survival time for ACC patients was 19 months vs. 48 months for NST patients (p &lt; 0.001). A complete-case approach was utilized for the adjusted analyses, restricting the sample to 46 257 patients without missing data on all relevant covariates. The adjusted Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated a more pronounced decline in survival probabilities among patients with ACC compared to those with NST, with the number at risk in the ACC group diminishing to four patients by the 30-month mark. In contrast, NST patients exhibited a more gradual decrease. In the multivariable Cox regression, which adjusted for age, TNM stage, HR/HER2, and chemotherapy, ACC histology was correlated with a 1.69-fold increase in the hazard of death (HR: 1.69; 95% CI: 0.63-4.56), although this result was not statistically significant. Age and advanced stage continued to be strong predictors of poor survival, and the inclusion of an age-time interaction enhanced the model fit.
Acinic cell carcinoma of the breast is a very rare primary breast malignancy. Our study indicates potentially aggressive clinical behavior in mammary ACC; however, findings must be interpreted cautiously given inherent SEER limitations, especially regarding histologic and molecular subtyping accuracy. Further centralized studies are urgently needed for the accurate characterization of this rare entity.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-50">摘要</h3>
<p>This study explored the preferences about features, policies, and location of long-term care (LTC) facilities among cis- and transgender individuals with different forms of sexual orientation, that is, identified as lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB), in comparison with each other and to those identified as heterosexual (HET) in Germany.
Cross-sectional survey.
A quota-sample of n = 4000 participants aged 40 to 70 years (n = 333 identified as LGB), including cis- and transgender individuals, drawn from the Online Access Panel of Respondi/Bilendi (German market research institute).
Participants rated the importance of LTC facilities’ features and policy (eg, living with spouse, permitted a pet) and location (eg, in a city). Analyses were conducted with adjusted multiple regression analyses with robust standard errors.
LGB participants rated a location within a city, permission for intimate relationships, lesbian, gay, bi, and trans (LGBT)-friendly and LGBT-only LTC facilities as significantly more important and HET-only LTC facilities as significantly less important than HET participants. Compared with gay men, bisexual men rated LGBT-friendly and LGBT-only LTC facilities as less important, whereas lesbian women placed more importance on having their own room and keeping pets. Bisexual women placed less importance on LGBT-only LTC facilities and location within a city, but more importance on keeping pets than gay men.
Preferences concerning LTC facilities were reported by individuals with different sexual orientation, including cis- and transgender adults in Germany. The LGB and HET community reported different preferences for policies, features, and location of LTC facilities, highlighting the importance of creating a welcoming space for the LGB community. Differences in preferences between gay, lesbian, and especially the understudied bisexual community further emphasized the need to take a diversified approach to research and policy decisions on LTC facilities.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-51">摘要</h3>
<p>Genotype and environmental factors (location and planting year) affect the food quality of soybeans. This study’s objective was to explore the impact of genotype, location, and year on seed components and to identify the correlations between seed components and the firmness of tofu. Seventeen soybean genotypes were grown in replicated field trials in Mississippi, Virginia, and Missouri in 2017 and 2018. Tofu was made from soybean by filled and pressed methods. The major storage proteins’ subunit composition, protein’s secondary structures, phytic acid content, and Ca2+ and Mg2+ contents were determined. Results showed both environmental factors, which varied over years and locations, and genotypes had significant interactions (“year × location × genotype,” p ≤ 0.001) on seed components. Overall 2-year data demonstrated that the A3 polypeptide quantitatively correlated with filled tofu firmness (FF) (r = 0.82, p ≤ 0.001) and with pressed tofu firmness (r = 0.83, p ≤ 0.001). In addition, overall data demonstrated that β-secondary structures (β-sheet + β-turn) positively correlated with the pressed and FF with r = 0.89 and 0.88, respectively. Within each trial, the genotype with higher A3 polypeptide generally produced tofu with higher firmness; for instance, in the 2018 Missouri trial, MS-01 and MS-18 soybeans had 3.54% (high) and 1.93% (low) A3 with firmness 141.57 (high) and 97 gf/cm2 (low), respectively. For applications, A3 polypeptide and β-secondary structures may be further developed into factors for selecting soybean genotypes for tofu production by the food industry or for breeders to develop new genotypes for improving tofu firmness. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This study investigates the relationships of chemical composition and tofu making of 17 soybean genotypes grown in three locations over 2 years. The results demonstrated that glycinin polypeptide A3 and β-structures (β-sheet + β-turn) of soybean proteins correlated significantly with tofu firmness. These protein factors can be utilized by both the food industry and plant breeders in their selections of value-added food-grade soybean for tofu quality improvement.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-53">摘要</h3>
<p>This study aimed to evaluate the beneficial effects of umbelliferone (UMB) (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg) in a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced rat model of sepsis, focusing on inflammation and oxidative stress mechanisms. Thirty-six Wistar albino rats were randomly assigned to six groups: Control, Sham, Sepsis, and Sepsis treated with three different doses of umbelliferone. Inflammatory cytokines were measured by ELISA, oxidative stress markers by tissue biochemistry, while protein expression and immune cell density were assessed using Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Sepsis markedly increased pro-inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress parameters, and NF-κB/CD68 immunopositivity, while reducing antioxidant defenses. UMB administration dose-dependently reversed these alterations, reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines, enhancing anti-inflammatory cytokines, restoring antioxidant balance, and significantly decreasing Nrf2 expression. Umbelliferone confers protection against sepsis-induced acute lung injury through multiple mechanisms, including suppression of NF-κB signaling, modulation of cytokine balance, and activation of the Nrf2/Keap1/HO-1 pathway. These findings highlight its potential as a natural therapeutic candidate for sepsis-related organ injury.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-54">摘要</h3>
<p>Microtransitions-defined as brief, nonurgent transitions in care-occur in post-acute and long-term care (PALTC) settings (eg, room changes, nonmedical outings, and medical outings). They occur at least as frequently as major transitions (eg, hospitalizations, discharges) and carry similar risks for adverse clinical outcomes if not properly managed. Limited evidence exists to guide safe microtransition coordination. This study aimed to establish best practice recommendations for staff facilitating microtransitions and evaluate the level of feasibility and clinical benefit of these recommendations in PALTC.
Modified Delphi study.
A total of 39 expert panelists.
Initial statements were developed based on a focus group and literature review. Consensus was defined as ≥80% agreement. Over 3 rounds, statements on safely facilitating room changes, recreational trips, and nonurgent (eg, outpatient) medical appointments were evaluated by panelists, then amended based on qualitative survey and focus group feedback until consensus was reached that statements were feasible and clinically beneficial. Five principles of important considerations for successful microtransitions were developed, and recommendations were categorized according to these principles: (1) communication; (2) adverse event monitoring, preparation, and prevention; (3) purpose and destination of transition; (4) equipment and environmental safety; and (5) skill level of the escort.
Fifty-one of the 70 finalized (72.9%) statements reached consensus for feasibility and/or clinical benefit for at least 1 type of microtransition. Of these, 41 of 51 (80.4%) reached consensus for feasibility, 49 of 51 (96.1%) reached consensus for clinical benefit, 39 of 51 (76.5%) statements reached consensus for both feasibility and clinical benefit, and 19 of 70 (27.1%) statements did not reach consensus or were rejected.
This is the first study to develop recommendations guiding PALTC staff in facilitating microtransitions. Implementing these recommendations may mitigate adverse event risk, such as falls and emergency departments transfers. Recommendations can guide situation-specific, patient-centered processes in coordinating safe microtransitions.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-55">摘要</h3>
<p>Microtransitions are brief, nonurgent transitions in care, such as room changes, recreational outings, and outpatient medical visits. Microtransitions occur at least as frequently as major transitions (eg, hospitalizations, discharges, etc.) and carry similar risks for adverse clinical outcomes if not properly managed. Post-acute and long-term care (PALTC) staff may be challenged to implement certain best practice recommendations for microtransitions. The objective of this study was to explore barriers and facilitators to successful execution of these recommendations in PALTC.
Qualitative study.
A total of 39 panelists from the PALTmed modified Delphi study on best practices for microtransitions in care.
Through 3 surveys and a focus group, panelists described implementation of best practice recommendations for microtransitions within PALTC settings. Panelist feedback was thematically analyzed to identify barriers and facilitators of successful microtransitions at patient, staff, and systems levels. Panelists’ views on regulations related to microtransitions were explored using content analysis.
Patient-level themes included safety and resident rights. Panelists emphasized that many microtransition-related standards of care are inconsistently implemented. Staff-level themes included burden, importance of communication, and training. Systems-level themes included staffing, regulation, material resource, and liability concerns, as well as “already standard of care.” Most panelists agreed that microtransition needs vary by facility characteristics and patient-specific needs and would not benefit from federal (71.4%) or state regulations (74.3%). There was consensus (91.4%) that regularly updated best-practice recommendations are advisable.
The care coordination required for successful execution of a microtransition is complex. Using best practice recommendations during microtransitions for PALTC residents may mitigate adverse event risk. However, ethical, liability, and regulatory barriers may limit effective implementation. Regulations around microtransitions may do more harm than good when it comes to improving patient care. Future research on interventions to facilitate adoption of best practices are needed.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-56">摘要</h3>
<p>Evidence from both epidemiology and toxicology suggests that exposure to individual air pollutant during pregnancy can impair intrauterine skeletal development, but the joint effects of pollutant mixtures and the mediating biological pathways are poorly understood. Within a Chinese birth cohort comprising 470 mother-infant pairs, we investigated the associations between joint exposure to six common air pollutants (fine particulate matter and inhalable particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and ozone) and markers of intrauterine skeletal development (intrauterine femur length and birth length). We further explored the potential mediating role of placental metabolites in these observed associations. Our results show that joint exposure to air pollutants during the third trimester was inversely associated with femur length in utero and birth length, in which PM2.5 was the primary contributor. Specifically, each quintile increase in the mixture was linked to decreases in femur length (β = -0.08 SD; 95 % CI: -0.16, -0.01) and birth length (β = -0.11 SD; 95 % CI: -0.19, -0.03). Placental metabolomic analysis identified that arachidonic acid metabolism was significantly linked to both air pollutants and intrauterine skeletal development. Specifically, arachidonic acid-metabolomic score was positively associated with joint exposure to air pollutants but negatively associated with birth length. Prostaglandins, including prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin F2α mediated 4.16-7.24 % of the observed inverse associations. Our findings suggest that maternal third trimester joint exposure to air pollutants may adversely affect intrauterine skeletal growth, potentially through disrupting placental arachidonic acid metabolism.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-57">摘要</h3>
<p>Digital Eye Strain is an emerging occupational health concern with significant implications for digital well-being. To address the need for scalable and objective monitoring, EyeStrainNet is proposed. It is a multimodal and explainable health informatics framework that integrates thermal imaging and behavioral metrics for the non-invasive detection of Digital Eye Strain. Thermal images were captured pre- and post-screen exposure using a FLIR Edge Pro camera, and ocular temperature features were extracted from the inner and outer canthus and central cornea. Behavioral data, such as screen exposure duration and distraction levels, were recorded in parallel. A total of 197 samples (34 with significant strain, 163 without) were analyzed. Feature engineering and statistical analysis revealed strong correlations between ocular temperature changes and behavioral factors. The proposed EyeStrainNet, based on a one-dimensional convolutional neural network, was evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation. It achieved 97.5 % accuracy, 92.5 % precision, 94.3 % recall, 92.7 % F1-score, 99.7 % ROC-AUC, and 98.9 % PR-AUC, demonstrating strong performance with tight confidence intervals. EyeStrainNet outperformed baseline models such as One-Class SVM and XGBoost-SVM by 2-3 % in accuracy and 5-10 % in F1-score. SHAP-based explainability analysis identified temperature variation and distraction as dominant predictive features. This multimodal, explainable, and data-driven framework enables early-stage, non-clinical DES detection, promoting proactive digital wellness.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-58">摘要</h3>
<p>Schizophrenia is a severe and disabling condition with a multi-factorial etiology. Recent literature hypothesized a role of environmental factors in the onset and course of the disorder. The purpose of the present article is to investigate the association of different air pollutants and apparent temperature (AT) with schizophrenia severity. We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study on 278 patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, who were recruited between 2002 and 2021 in Milan, Italy, for a total of 890 hospital admissions. Demographic, biological, and medical data were obtained from clinical charts and intranet hospital applications. Disorder severity was assessed by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). For each subject, exposure to particulate matter (PM) PM2.5, PM10, and black carbon (BC) on the day of hospitalization and on the previous six days was estimated based on regional monitoring of air quality. AT was also calculated. Associations were assessed by a distributed lag non-linear model approach. Cumulative short-term exposure to particulate pollutants was associated with increased PANSS in the Spring-Summer period (for PM10: β=1.52 (95 % CI: 0.50, 2.55)), with larger single-lag increments when approaching to the day of hospital admission. Instead, increasing AT was associated with schizophrenia worsening only in the Autumn-Winter period, when considering exposure on day 0 (β=0.50 (95 % CI: 0.09, 0.91)) and day -1 (β=0.30 (95 % CI: 0.10, 0.50)). These findings highlight air pollution and AT as modifiable risk factors for schizophrenia severity, particularly during certain seasons, and underscore the need for further research on preventive strategies.</p>
