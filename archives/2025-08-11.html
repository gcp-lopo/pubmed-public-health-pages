<h2 id="article-1">1. Construction of a Self-Enhanced Fluorescent Aptasensor Based on Lanthanide Ligand Self-Assembly and Catalytic Hairpin Assembly for Highly-Sensitive Detection of Anatoxin-a.</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: Analytical chemistry

<h3 id="摘要">摘要</h3>
<p>Anatoxin-a (ATX-a) is a potent neurotoxin produced by cyanobacteria, with growing evidence unequivocally linking it to acute aquatic toxicity, neurological impairment, and increased mortality in wildlife and livestock, highlighting its significant threat to ecosystem stability and public health. Here, we report a novel fluorescent aptasensor system (FAS) that integrates novel DNA-functionalized Eu nanoparticles (DNA-Eu NPs) with a catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) strategy for ultrasensitive ATX-a detection. We used single-stranded DNA C16T20A16 (ssDNA) oligomers rich in cytosine, thymine, and adenine as effective antenna ligands to sensitize the luminescence of Eu. The Black Hole Quencher (BHQ) labeled hairpin DNA (H3) hybridizes with the exposed DNA sequence on the surface of NPs through complementary base pairing, promoting the fluorescence energy transfer between the quenching group BHQ and DNA-Eu NPs, leading to the formation of DNA-Eu-H3 and providing stable “on-off” fluorescence. In the presence of ATX-a, it specifically binds to the aptamer (B) to release trigger DNA (T) from duplex DNA (B-T). T initiates a CHA-driven cascade amplification between H1, H2, and DNA-Eu-H3, resulting in fluorescence recovery and signal amplification of DNA-Eu NPs. This FAS exhibits good stability, excellent specificity, and high sensitivity, with a detection limit (LOD) of 0.30 pg/mL and a linear range of 0.001-500 ng/mL. This strategy provides an innovative, highly sensitive, label-free assay and is expected to be a powerful tool for environmental toxin analysis.</p>

<h2 id="article-2">2. Neurotoxicity of chemotherapy and brain-radiotherapy in cancer: overlapping mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment.</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: Journal of clinical and experimental neuropsychology

<h3 id="摘要-1">摘要</h3>
<p>Cancer and its treatments often result in cognitive impairment (CRCI), impacting the well-being of survivors. Chemotherapy and brain-targeted radiation therapy contribute significantly to central nervous system toxicity, which underlies these cognitive issues. Preclinical animal studies serve as pivotal tools in elucidating the cellular and molecular changes triggered by cancer therapies. This review assesses both clinical and preclinical evidence, offering insights into optimal preclinical study designs to deepen our understanding of the underlying injury mechanisms. Such understanding is crucial and adapted to precision medicine for advancing preventive and restorative interventions. Early interventions show promising outcomes, underscoring the importance of identifying predictive biomarkers for patient stratification.
Mechanisms underlying chemo- and radiotherapy-induced cognitive impairment are multifactorial, involving (neuro)inflammation, blood-brain-barrier disruption, impaired neurogenesis, loss of oligodendrocyte lineage cells and cellular senescence.Some injury mechanisms are more uniquely linked to specific treatment modalities, such as systemic inflammation to chemotherapy and long-term brain vascular damage to irradiation.Circulating cytokines, Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) levels in blood, and genetic factors are promising biomarkers predictive of chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment in patients.There is a significant unmet medical need to develop novel and mechanistically driven therapies for patients with CRCI.Clinical scenarios with multiple lines of treatment and complex multimodal regimens are difficult to model in animal systems but considered essential to identify underlying mechanisms.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-2">摘要</h3>
<p>To establish recommendations based on an expert consensus on the early and appropriate use of high-efficacy disease-modifying therapies (HE-DMTs) in the management of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, based on current clinical evidence and real-world practice in Italy.
A Delphi panel comprising 65 neurologists from 54 Italian MS centers engaged in a two-round consensus process. Experts rated 43 statements across five domains: therapeutic goals, definitions of HE-DMT, MS patient profiling, and use of HE-DMT at diagnosis and later in MS course, using a 5-point Likert scale. A statement reached strong consensus if ≥80% of panelists agreed; whereas between 70% and 80% it was considered as moderate.
 In Round 2, 53 experts completed the survey on 43 statements. Strong consensus was achieved for 33 (76.7%), and moderate consensus for 6 (14.0%) statements. Experts strongly supported early HE-DMT initiation to prevent irreversible disability, endorsed a multidimensional definitions of treatment efficacy, and recommended personalized approaches based on clinical, radiological, and biomarker indicators. Consensus supported initiating HE-DMTs in patients with poor prognostic features and identified magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) activity, neurodegeneration markers, and suboptimal clinical response as specific factors requiring escalation to HE-DMTs.
This Italian Delphi underscores the importance of early, personalized HE-DMT use to optimize long-term outcomes in MS. The strong expert alignment reflects a paradigm shift toward proactive treatment and highlights actionable clinical, radiological, and biological indicators that should guide therapeutic decisions. These findings may support national policy changes and promote more equitable and evidence-based access to HE-DMTs across healthcare systems.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-3">摘要</h3>
<p>The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) is the sole U.S. policy protecting job security during medical or parental leave. We extend prior work by analyzing overall FMLA eligibility by citizenship and gender among Hispanic workers. We examine which criteria-employer size, job tenure, and minimum work hours-drive citizenship disparities. We also investigate the factors predicting FMLA eligibility and examine the population-level characteristics contributing to FMLA citizenship disparities.
We used the 2018 Current Population Survey (n = 5632) to compare FMLA eligibility by citizenship status among Hispanic foreign-born workers by sex. We used multivariate linear regressions and Blinder-Oaxaca decompositions to investigate citizenship inequities in FMLA eligibility.
Findings showed eligibility disparities: 38.9% of noncitizen men and 42.2% of noncitizen women met FMLA criteria compared to over half of their citizen counterparts. For men, this disparity stemmed primarily from differences in employer size, with less than half of non-citizens working for eligible employers. For women, both employer size and job tenure contributed to the ineligibility. Decomposition analyses showed that educational and occupational differences explained roughly half the employer-size citizenship disparity among men. Among women, occupation, full-time status, and education accounted for 85% of the employer size disparity. Age, residency duration, and full-time status explained nearly 75% of the job tenure citizen gap.
The FMLA’s design excludes Hispanic non-citizens during critical life events. Addressing occupational segregation and educational barriers and modifying eligibility criteria are crucial to mitigating these disparities. A national paid family and medical leave policy is urgently needed.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-4">摘要</h3>
<p>Accurate diagnosis and timely treatment of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) are crucial to preventing progression to other liver diseases or failure. Cellular redox balance may be linked to DILI. Hypochlorous acid (HClO) and glutathione (GSH) are key redox pairs reflecting cellular status. Ferroptosis is critical for understanding liver injury mechanisms. Studies show that DILI is associated with lipid droplet (LD) dysfunction. LDs, essential for lipid metabolism and storage, are linked to ferroptosis and fatty liver. Developing fluorescent probes for LD imaging is vital for studying dynamic physiological processes. Currently, no reversible probes exist to monitor the HClO/GSH redox balance, especially in LDs. To address this, we developed the NIR ratio-fluorescent probe PSeZ-ZD to dynamically monitor the HClO/GSH balance in LDs during ferroptosis and DILI. PSeZ-ZD enables NIR ratio imaging, targets LDs, and detects oxidants and antioxidants. It has detection limits of 51.1 nM for HClO and 1.575 μM for GSH. At the cellular level, PSeZ-ZD successfully images HClO fluctuations with excellent reversibility and LD targeting. It also monitors in situ HClO/GSH in APAP- or INH-induced DILI and evaluates NAC, silybin, and their combination. This probe provides a valuable tool for early DILI diagnosis and treatment, offering new insights into ferroptosis in DILI.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-5">摘要</h3>
<p>Cognitive aging, a pivotal domain at the intersection of neuroscience and psychology, exhibits a strong association with neurodegenerative disorders; however, its comprehensive underlying mechanisms remain incompletely elucidated. This review aims to provide a thorough synthesis of recent advancements in the investigation of cognitive aging in the brain, highlighting multidimensional assessment techniques, neurobiological foundations, molecular regulatory pathways, systemic changes, environmental-gene interactions, and intervention strategies. Evidence suggests that cognitive aging is marked not only by widespread neuronal loss but also by subtle modifications within neural networks, protein homeostasis, mitochondrial functionality, and epigenetic regulation. The integration of various technological methodologies has shed light on the continuum that exists between cognitive aging and neurodegenerative disorders. Concurrently, multidimensional intervention strategies are being proposed; however, current research frameworks face challenges due to limitations in biomarker systems, indicating a need for a paradigm shift. Future investigations should leverage emerging technologies to develop more precise regulatory frameworks and personalized intervention strategies aimed at addressing the global challenges associated with aging, thereby enhancing the prevention and treatment of related pathologies.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-6">摘要</h3>
<p>We studied the associations between the state of the vascular wall in the coronary and carotid arteries with bone mineral density (BMD) and the bone turnover marker.
To examine the associations of arterial stiffness, atherosclerotic plaque (ASP) and coronary artery calcification (CAC) parameters with BMD and bone resorption marker CTX.
Our cross-sectional study included 357 outpatient-women 45 to 82 years of age. Intima-media thickness (IMT), presence, and number of ASP in the carotid arteries were studied using duplex ultrasound imaging. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AI) were assessed via applanation tonometry method. Coronary artery calcification (CAC) on multislice computed tomography was scored using the Agatston calcium index (ACI). BMD was measured using by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX) was investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
Women with osteoporosis had higher IMT values (p = 0.045), more ASP (p &lt; 0.001), and higher ACI (p &lt; 0.001) than those with normal BMD values. In a multivariate linear regression analysis adjusted for age, duration of postmenopause, BMI, and levels of CTX and ALP in blood serum, we confirmed that ACI makes an independent contribution to the reduction in BMD of all measured parts of the skeleton, while IMT and the presence of ASP contribute to the reduction in BMD of femoral neck.
The results of our study demonstrated an association between vascular calcification, the presence of ASP in the carotid arteries and low bone mass in women without clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis, which is of clinical significance and important for the prevention of both osteoporotic fractures and cardiovascular incidents.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-7">摘要</h3>
<p>The combined impact of high iodine and high fluoride exposure has garnered increased attention. To determine whether exposure to high levels of fluoride and iodine in water has adverse effects on children’s teeth. In this study, 582 children aged 8 to 12 from rural Jiangsu, China, were divided into three groups based on the concentrations of iodine and fluoride in their drinking water: a high fluoride and high iodine group (HFHI), a high fluoride group (HF), and a control group (CONTROL). We employed the ion-selective electrode method to measure fluoride levels in urine samples and used inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry to assess urinary iodine (UI) levels. The prevalence and severity of dental fluorosis (DF) were determined using Dean’s Index in accordance with WHO criteria. A logistic regression model was used to analyze factors related to dental fluorosis. The urinary fluoride (UF) regression coefficients were compared using the Z-test to assess their influence. The results indicate that the prevalence of DF was 52.5, 33.5, and 4.1% in the HFHI, HF, and CONTROL groups, respectively. There were statistically significant differences in both the prevalence and severity of DF among the groups (P &lt; 0.001 for both). The dental fluorosis indexes (DFI) were calculated as 1.2, 0.7, and 0.1 for the HFHI, HF, and CONTROL groups, respectively. UF levels were positively associated with DF in the HFHI and HF groups, with adjusted odds ratios (OR) of 5.30 and 3.12, respectively. The Z-test results showed statistically significant differences (HFHI vs. CONTROL, P &lt; 0.001; HF vs. CONTROL, P = 0.048; HFHI vs. HF, P &lt; 0.001). UF levels &gt; 1.4 mg/L and UI &gt; 300 μg/L demonstrated a significant interaction in the HFHI group (OR = 9.62, 95% CI 2.70-18.36, P &lt; 0.001) and Overall (OR = 9.15, 95% CI 2.71-16.58, P &lt; 0.001). Simultaneous exposure to high iodine and high fluoride in water adversely impacts the incidence of DF in school-age children. It is recommended that monitoring of UI levels in children from high fluoride regions be enhanced.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-8">摘要</h3>
<p>An estimated 800 million people globally are reported to be suffering from lead poisoning. In India, lead exposure has affected many states such as Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh. The current research study has been conducted in various districts for Bihar such as Patna, Vaishali, Saran, Nalanda, Buxar and Bhojpur for the first time to estimate the lead exposure levels in subjects. The study was conducted on n = 282 lactating mothers and their breastfed infants. In the studied n = 282 lactating mother’s blood samples, 94% had lead contamination higher than the WHO permissible limit of 50 µg/L. In the lactating mother’s urine samples, 90% had lead contamination higher than the WHO permissible limit of 50 µg/L. Similarly, in the child’s urine study, 41% had lead contamination higher than the WHO permissible limit of 50 µg/L. However, the analysed household handpump water also had lead contamination in 6% of the water sources more than the WHO permissible limit of 10 µg/L, while 94% of water sources had safer levels. This indicates that the source of lead contamination in biological samples of the studied subjects was mildly due to lead contaminated water. Hence, food, vegetables, animal milk or animal meat could be the source of lead contamination in the exposed subjects. Moreover, this could also be due to the use of local market turmeric, use of ayurvedic medicines, cosmetic - whitening creams by the exposed subjects. The long-term exposure to lead has caused non-carcinogenic HQ higher values i.e. &gt; 1 in child and their mothers. Hence, the current study concludes that significant amount of lead contamination was observed in the exposed population’s biological samples. The exposed lactating mother’s breastfed infants are at high risk of developing neurological disorders which could cause severe health risk to them. The study recommends the state Government to take preventive measures to control the lead poisoning within the exposed community of Bihar (India).</p>

<h3 id="摘要-9">摘要</h3>
<p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the most prevalent and deadly cancers worldwide. Chronic liver disease is the most established risk factor for HCC, but environmental exposures are increasingly recognized as contributor. In this narrative review, we sought to analyze data linking three substances to HCC: polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and cadmium.
We performed a literature search of MEDLINE for this narrative review. Two reviewers screened titles and abstracts for relevance. We focused on articles published within the last three years.
PAH, PFAS, and cadmium have been linked to chronic liver disease, liver injury, and to a lesser extent, HCC. Major limitations in existing data are small sample sizes, lack of longitudinal follow up (most studies are cross-sectional), and heterogeneity in the species assayed and the methods of assay.
Further studies in large, prospective cohorts with longitudinal follow up are needed. Given existing evidence linking these substances to liver injury and HCC, a multi-faceted prevention and intervention strategy is needed, incorporating research, public education and engagement, legal frameworks, decontamination and medical interventions to mitigate deleterious effects of these substances.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-10">摘要</h3>
<p>Shiga toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC) is known to cause severe diarrhea and other gastrointestinal disorders in animals and humans. The galE gene encodes the galE protein, which acts as an essential catalyst required to convert UDP-galactose into UDP-glucose, and vital for exopolysaccharide synthesis. In this study, a knockout mutant of the STEC galE gene (ΔgalE) was constructed and the biological functions of galE were analyzed. Relative to the wild-type strain, O-antigen synthesis within the ΔgalE mutant changed and displayed distinct profiles via SDS-PAGE coupled with silver staining and Western blot analysis. Furthermore, this mutant showed a reduction in swimming motility, diminished biofilm formation, and reduced replication within macrophages. In the complement-killing assay, the membrane attack complex (MAC) was deposited in greater amounts on the ΔgalE-deficient strain relative to the wild-type strain, indicating a higher susceptibility of the ΔgalE strain toward complement-dependent lysis. However, the mutant manifested a more pronounced tolerance to extreme environments despite exhibiting comparable replication in a growth medium. These results indicate that galE plays a significant roles in O-antigen biosynthesis and contributes to STEC pathogenicity.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-12">摘要</h3>
<p>Wellbeing in adolescence is an important opportunity to shape healthy futures. However, psychosocial distress is high amongst adolescents, and rural Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adolescents are at an increased risk. Situated within a rural Queensland community-controlled health service, this research explored community perceptions of an adolescent social and emotional wellbeing program.
Through yarning circles, adolescents, parents/guardians, community leaders, Elders and health service staff shared their perceptions of the program. Participants were purposively sampled through their existing community-controlled engagement forums. Data were audio-recorded, transcribed, and thematically analysed using NVivo 11.
Thirty people (n=30) participated in the research, of whom, 83% identified as Aboriginal. Four themes suggest the program is highly valued. Participants perceived the program as improving adolescent confidence and empowerment, preparing adolescents for adulthood and providing positive role models. Participants felt the program should be upscaled and sustained.
The program was perceived as achieving its target outcomes, and several success factors were identified that are consistent with the literature.
The program is an example of how adolescent social and emotional wellbeing can be done well in the community-controlled setting. Exploring program expansion and further evaluation is encouraged.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-13">摘要</h3>
<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are among the most common neurodevelopmental disorders. However, significant gaps persist in understanding health and healthcare-related needs of individuals diagnosed with ASD and/or ADHD across the lifespan. Thus, this real-world evaluation sought to characterize the prevalence of ASD, ADHD, and co-existing ASD and ADHD (AuDHD); sociodemographics; frequent comorbidities and co-occurring diagnoses; and healthcare utilization and expenditures among members of a large national payor.
This study represents an observational, cross-sectional evaluation of claims from a large national payor. Retrospective claims analyses of commercial fully insured (C-FI) members from 1/1/2022-12/31/2022 identified diagnoses for ASD and/or ADHD among adults (≥ 18 year) and children (&lt; 18 year). Chi-squared tests, T-tests, and Fisher’s exact tests examined between-group differences in sociodemographic, health, and healthcare-related measures among members with neurodevelopmental disorders compared to members without ASD and/or ADHD.
Within adults (N = 1,928,106), 4.2% of members (60.2% White, 52.9% female, mean age: 34.1 ± 10.9 year) were diagnosed with neurodevelopmental disorders: ADHD (4.0%, n = 76,515); ASD (0.1%, n = 2,134); or AuDHD (0.1%, n = 1,266) (all P &lt; 0.0001). Within children (N = 464,749), 6.7% of members (47.8% White, 67.5% male, mean age: 11.3 ± 3.8 year) were diagnosed with neurodevelopmental disorders: ADHD (5.0%, n = 23,250); ASD (1.1%, n = 5,098); or AuDHD (0.6%, n = 2,665) (all P &lt; 0.0001). Increased odds (i.e., ≥ 2) for certain co-occurring diagnoses were consistently observed across all three neurodevelopmental cohorts for adults and children, which were primarily behavioral health (BH)-related. Compared to those without neurodevelopmental disorders, both adults and children with ASD and/or ADHD had higher healthcare utilization rates [adults: 615.2 to 1024.8 per thousand per month (PTPM); children: 398.4 to 1205.3 PTPM; all P &lt; 0.001)]; largely owing to increased use of BH-related services, translating to greater total healthcare expenditures [adults: $140.3 to $292.1 per member per month (PMPM); children: $50.8 to $845.4 PMPM; all P &lt; 0.001)].
Leveraging real-world data of 2,392,855 members from a large national payor, 4.1% of adults and 6.7% of children were diagnosed with ASD and/or ADHD. This population appeared to consistently exhibit specific co-existing diagnoses that frequently co-occur in addition to greater observed healthcare utilization and expenditures.

<h3 id="摘要-14">摘要</h3>
<p>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a pressing global public health challenge that requires coordinated multi-sectoral responses under the One Health framework. In line with the Global Action Plan (GAP) on AMR, Jordan developed its first National Action Plan (NAP) for 2018-2022 to guide national efforts. This study aimed to evaluate the implementation of Jordan’s AMR NAP 2018-2022, identify progress and challenges across its five strategic objectives, and suggest actionable recommendations for strengthening future AMR responses.
A comprehensive end-term evaluation was conducted for the NAP 2018-2022 by the Jordan Center for Disease Control (Jordan CDC), utilizing a structured evaluation tool including sector-specific and multi-sectoral indicators aligned with the five objectives of the AMR NAP. Data were collected via national stakeholder workshop and follow-up electronic communications, with consensus-based completion by multi-sectoral working groups. Descriptive analysis was used to assess implementation across human, animal, food and environmental sectors, applying the One Health approach.
The evaluation revealed uneven implementation across sectors and NAP objectives, with notable achievements in the rational use of antimicrobials (69%), mainly in the human health sector, followed by infection prevention and control (IPC) efforts (63%), and surveillance-related activities (56%). Lower progress was reported for awareness activities (47%), while research and innovation activities were not implemented during 2018-2022. Although human health sector activities dominated, gaps persisted across the animal, food, and environmental sectors. Limited intersectoral coordination, the absence of a unified communication strategy, lack of dedicated funding, insufficient investment in human resources and laboratories, and the disruptions caused by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic further constrained implementation. The findings underscore critical gaps in One Health surveillance integration, rational antimicrobial use in the food chain, and the need for robust AMR research governance.
Despite progress in different areas, the overall implementation revealed significant challenges, particularly in research, multi-sectoral collaboration, and the One Health integration. Future action should prioritize a unified national AMR policy framework for strategic planning, emphasizing resource distribution, active participation of all relevant sectors, and institutionalizing systematic monitoring and evaluation to inform policymaking. Strengthening coordination between human, animal, and environmental sectors is essential to achieving a robust, One Health-aligned AMR response in Jordan.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-15">摘要</h3>
<p>Stunting, a condition in which children fail to achieve their expected height for age, is a significant public health problem, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The nutrition and caring practices of mothers and children during the first 1000 days of life determine the ability of a child to develop, learn, and thrive; however, mothers who work may not be able to ensure that their child is receiving adequate nutrition in the early stages of life. This study aimed to identify the determinants of working mothers’ stunting prevention behavior, including individual factors, work-related stress, well-being, knowledge, and attitudes toward the behavior of working mothers in supporting the prevention of stunting in West Java Province, Indonesia.
This study used a cross-sectional design with a total sample of 225 working mothers in 78 offices mapped in Bandung city, Bekasi city, Bekasi Regency, Karawang Regency, West Bandung Regency, and Sumedang Regency in West Java Province, Indonesia. The inclusion criteria were as follows: working mothers aged 18 and above who reside and work in 6 cities/regencies of the study, have at least one child under the age of 5 years, and have consented to participate. The questionnaire consisted of demographic data and health characteristics, as well as questionnaires on knowledge, attitudes, work-related stress, well-being, and stunting prevention behavior. The data were analyzed using chi-square tests and logistic regression.
Among the 19 variables, two determinant factors influence stunting prevention behavior among working mothers in West Java Province, Indonesia. These factors are working mothers’ well-being (OR 3.30, P &lt; 0.001) and knowledge about stunting prevention (OR 2.79, P &lt; 0.001). A low level of well-being among working mothers increases the risk of poor stunting prevention behavior by 3.30 times. Similarly, insufficient knowledge about stunting prevention increases this risk by 2.79 times. The interplay between well-being and knowledge may improve mothers’ stunting prevention behavior.
Working mothers’ well-being and knowledge of stunting prevention affect their stunting prevention behavior. This study is the first in Indonesia to explore the determinant factors of stunting prevention behavior among working mothers. Working mothers should receive special attention from the government regarding their rights to improve their well-being and knowledge related to their health. Further research should adopt longitudinal and intervention-based designs, include other caregivers, and explore diverse geographic and employment settings. Research on workplace and policy-level support systems is also recommended to inform more comprehensive strategies for improving child health outcomes.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-16">摘要</h3>
<p>We performed a systematic survey to collate studies on prediction models developed on the basis of meta-analysis in medicine and summarize key steps involved in model development.
We systematically searched Web of Science, PubMed and Embase until April 2023 and included those that developed prediction models on the basis of meta-analysis. The data were summarized via narrative synthesis.
The search strategy identified 23 studies with 25 prediction models that met the eligibility criteria. The predicted outcomes focused on complications of diabetes, mortality, cognitive impairment, gestational diabetes, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, bacterial sinusitis, seizures, and psychosis. Twenty-three prediction models reported AUCs, with a median value of 0.77 (range: 0.59-0.91). Ten prediction models were developed with sample sizes exceeding 10,000 participants. The key steps in developing prediction models via meta-analysis include (1) confirming that the prediction model meets clinical needs before starting, (2) collecting data through meta-analysis to select predictors, (3) developing prediction models, (4) validating prediction model performance, (5) presenting and interpreting models and (6) reporting models.
The development of prediction models based on meta-analysis may represent a promising approach, which demonstrates good discrimination. Guidance is necessary to support the design, implementation and reporting of future prediction model development via meta-analysis.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-17">摘要</h3>
<p>There is increasing evidence to suggest that physical activity can slow Parkinson’s progression. There is also increasing interest in non-pharmacological interventions to alleviate Parkinson’s symptoms. This scoping review aimed to map and describe the evidence for interventions that promote physical activity in people with newly diagnosed Parkinson’s.
Studies conducted since 2011, on adults with Parkinson’s (≥ 18 years), investigating the effects of non-pharmacological interventions to promote physical activity and/or exercise were considered. Interventions needed to be conducted in healthcare or healthcare-related settings for people within 5 years of Parkinson’s diagnosis. Published or unpublished full-text articles since 2011 were searched in November 2023, using online focused, broad, and grey literature databases. JBI scoping review methodology was used and results presented in table format accompanied by a narrative review.
A total of 22 articles with a variety of research designs were included with 14 randomized trials, one single-site, prospective, single-arm study, two retrospective cohort studies, one case series, two case reports, and two qualitative reports. Many studies (n = 7) were conducted in outpatient clinics with the majority of interventions (n = 17) involving physiotherapists. Interventions varied widely, including aerobic exercise, balance exercise, dance, and yoga. The duration of intervention varied from 4 weeks to 8 years. Dosage of interventions varied widely from 30 to 90 min, and from twice weekly to seven times weekly. Several different outcome measures related to physical activity levels and/or physical fitness were used. The most frequent clinician/researcher reported outcome measure was the 6-min walk test (in nine studies) and the most frequently used participant/patient reported outcome measure was the 39-item Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) (also in nine studies). The review showed limited research in identifiable cohorts with newly diagnosed Parkinson’s. Sample sizes were predominantly small. In all but one study, authors interpreted their results as favoring interventions to promote physical activity for people with newly diagnosed Parkinson’s. All authors recommended further studies.
There is a need for more research with larger sample sizes and standardized reporting to inform the evidence base for interventions that promote physical activity in people with newly diagnosed Parkinson’s.

<h3 id="摘要-18">摘要</h3>
<p>Regular intramuscular injection of benzathine penicillin every two to four weeks is a critical and cost-effective secondary prevention strategy for reducing morbidity and mortality from rheumatic heart disease (RHD), particularly in resource-limited settings like Ethiopia. However, there is limited evidence of adherence to this prophylaxis. Therefore, this study aimed to assess adherence to benzathine penicillin prophylaxis used for secondary prevention and its associated factors among patients with RHD attending follow-up clinics at two public referral hospitals in Bahir Dar, Ethiopia.
A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 346 patients with RHD attending the follow-up clinic at Tibebe Ghion and Felege Hiwot specialized hospitals from October 1st, 2023 to January 20, 2024. Data was collected through questionnaire-based face-to-face interviews and a review of medical records. The data was entered into EpiData version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 27 for analysis. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with good adherence to benzathine penicillin prophylaxis. Adjusted odds ratio at a p-value of less than 0.05 was used to assess the strength of the statistical association.
Among 346 patients with RHD (97% response rate), the study found an overall adherence rate of 63.6% (95% CI, 58.6-68.8) to benzathine penicillin G (BPG) prophylaxis. Factors associated with good adherence included mild to moderate pain at the injection site (AOR = 2.44; 95% CI 1.45-4.09), good awareness of the purpose of BPG (AOR = 1.99; 95% CI, 1.11-3.59), urban residence of patients (AOR = 3.58, 95% CI 1.99-6.41), prophylaxis duration of ≤ 5 years (AOR = 4.15, 95% CI 1.58-10.88), prophylaxis duration 5-10 years (AOR = 3.83, 95% CI 1.32-11.13), and no history of admission in the last year (AOR = 3.05; 95% CI 1.67-5.54).
The level of good adherence in this study is sub-optimal. Factors positively associated with adherence included urban residence, mild to moderate injection site pain, awareness of BPG purpose, shorter prophylaxis duration, and absence of recent hospital admissions. To improve adherence, healthcare providers should implement targeted patient education programs and adopt effective pain management strategies as part of routine follow-up care.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-19">摘要</h3>
<p>Psychological distress represents a growing concern in contemporary society, with its prevalence often exacerbated by various demographic and health-related factors. Understanding the interplay of gender, socioeconomic status, education, and health conditions is crucial for developing effective mental health interventions. This original cohort-based study investigates the impact of gender, socioeconomic status (SES), education, and existing health conditions on psychological distress levels. This study utilized cross-sectional data from the Ravanser Non-Communicable Disease (RaNCD) cohort, focusing on Kurdish individuals aged 35 to 65 in the Ravanser district of Kermanshah, Iran. Psychological distress was evaluated seven years post-recruitment using a validated scale, involving 3,015 randomly selected participants from the original cohort. Descriptive statistics summarized psychological distress distributions, while multivariable linear regression models, adjusted for various covariates, explored associations between SES, education, and psychological distress, with significance set at p &lt; 0.05. Significant findings include higher psychological distress levels in females (20.56 ± 8.58) compared to males (17.41 ± 7.22) and a strong association with socioeconomic status, where poorer individuals reported greater psychological distress (20.52 ± 8.89) than their wealthier counterparts (16.84 ± 6.79). Education level was also critical, with illiterate individuals experiencing higher psychological distress (19.98 ± 8.42) compared to those with postgraduate education (17.43 ± 7.18). Additionally, individuals with cardiovascular disease (20.92 ± 8.75) and depression (24.82 ± 9.92) exhibited significantly higher psychological distress levels. These findings suggest that targeted interventions addressing mental health should consider demographic factors, socioeconomic status, education, and existing health conditions to effectively reduce psychological distress in vulnerable populations.Overall, these findings underscore the complex interplay of gender, SES, and education in influencing psychological distress, highlighting the need for targeted interventions.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-20">摘要</h3>
<p>Children’s physical fitness is a critical determinant of lifelong health, yet comprehensive investigations into its multi-level influencing factors remain limited, particularly in developing regions. Guided by the Ecological Model of Health Behavior, this cross-sectional study assessed the physical fitness status and associated determinants among 29,856 children aged 9-12 years in Shandong Province, China. Data were obtained from two primary sources: (1) standardized physical fitness assessments based on the National Physical Fitness Standards for Students of China (Revised 2014), and (2) validated questionnaires capturing individual behaviors, family environments, and lifestyle factors across multiple ecological levels. The physical fitness test qualification rate was adopted as the primary outcome indicator. Multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed that parental support for physical activity (OR = 0.297, 95% CI: 0.266-0.332), moderate-intensity exercise (OR = 0.872, 95% CI: 0.763-0.997), daily breakfast consumption (OR = 0.765, 95% CI: 0.626-0.936), and adequate sleep (6-8 h/day, OR = 0.569, 95% CI: 0.499-0.649) were significant protective factors for physical fitness test qualification. In contrast, daily exposure to secondhand smoke (OR = 1.212, 95% CI: 1.078-1.362), prolonged screen time (&gt; 3 h/day, OR = 1.712, 95% CI: 1.496-1.958), and excessive academic burden (&gt; 3 h/day, OR = 1.294, 95% CI: 1.158-1.447) were associated with increased risks of non-compliance. These findings underscore the multi-layered influences of personal behaviors, family dynamics, and environmental contexts on children’s physical fitness, consistent with the socio-ecological framework. This study provides robust empirical evidence for the development of comprehensive, multi-sectoral interventions targeting child health promotion in school-aged populations.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-21">摘要</h3>
<p>Chlorpyrifos is an organophosphorus pesticide which is most widely used in agricultural farmlands to control insect pests. Besides protecting crops from pests, chlorpyrifos enters into soil and water bodies, and pose serious health hazards to living organisms. Biodegradation involves the use of microorganisms to degrade pesticides into non-toxic substances. In the present study Aspergillus niger TC1 showed maximum degradation of chlorpyrifos. The isolate was able to tolerate 500 ppm concentration of chlorpyrifos and substantially degraded 400 ppm concentration of chlorpyrifos. Based on GC-MS analysis, Aspergillus niger TC1 degraded chlorpyrifos into 2,4 Bis (1,1 dimethyl ethyl) phenol, a fuel additive compound. Based on HPLC analysis, the percentage of chlorpyrifos degradation was calculated to be 95.2%. A temperature of 27 ℃ and pH 7 were identified as optimum conditions for maximum degradation of chlorpyrifos. The isolate showed positive results for Indole-3-Acetic Acid and ammonia production, along with phosphate and zinc solubilizing plant growth-promoting assays. Also, the isolate showed increased seed germination along with increased shoot and root length in the seed germination and pot assay. Further, Aspergillus niger TC1 showed significant biocontrol potential against Rhizoctonia solani and Fusarium oxysporum. The isolate showed significant degradation of chlorpyrifos along with plant growth promotion and biocontrol potential. While chlorpyrifos degradation by Aspergillus niger has been previously reported, this study is the first to comprehensively assess a single strain for its combined abilities in chlorpyrifos degradation, plant growth promotion, and biocontrol potential. The study shows that Aspergillus niger TC1 can be efficiently used for sustainable agriculture.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-22">摘要</h3>
<p>Screening for gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, specifically colorectal cancer (CRC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is often inadequately and inequitably implemented, leading to preventable morbidity and mortality. This protocol paper describes a study designed to compare the effectiveness of external facilitation with patient navigation across hospitals in the Veterans Health Administration (VA).
Two hybrid type 3, cluster-randomized trials will compare the effectiveness of patient navigation versus external facilitation for supporting HCC and CRC screening completion. Twenty-four sites will be included in the HCC trial and 32 in the CRC trial, cluster-randomizing Veterans by their site of primary care. The primary outcome of reach of cancer screening completion will be measured after intervention and during sustainment. Multi-level implementation determinants (i.e., barriers and facilitators), preconditions, and moderators will be evaluated pre- and post-intervention, using Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR)-mapped surveys and interviews of Veteran participants and provider participants.
Comparing findings in the two trials will allow researchers to understand how implementation barriers and strategies operate differently for a one-time screening in a relatively healthy population (CRC) vs. repeated screening in a more medically complex population (HCC).

<h3 id="摘要-23">摘要</h3>
<p>Food insecurity in Nigeria has persisted for decades, resisting various agricultural policies and programmes since the 1970s. This study investigates the impacts of traditional agriculture (TA), sustainable agriculture (SA), and industrial agriculture (IA) on food security in Nigeria from 2000 to 2022, using a system dynamics modelling approach supported by optimization and linear programming techniques. The model also accounts for climate change and land resource dynamics, integrating data from Nigeria and nine comparable countries to enhance robustness. Results show that while crop yield increased over time, food security fluctuated due to factors including land degradation and uneven food distribution. The findings highlight that improving agricultural productivity alone is insufficient; sustainable practices, climate adaptation, and improved distribution systems are essential for long-term food security in Nigeria.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-24">摘要</h3>
<p>Recent studies have shown that air pollution is among the most important triggers of mental health risks. However, little is known about the resilience strategies that reduce mental health risks among individuals exposed to pollution. The interconnections of protective and risk factors further complicate the understanding of mental health resilience. Therefore, this study developed a resilience assessment framework accounting for factor interconnections to evaluate the short-term air pollution-related mental health resilience.
Aligned with mental health resilience theory, a Bayesian network model and network analysis were applied to construct a quantitative network of factor interconnections, analyzing 2019-2020 data for 24,261 older adults from the Shandong Aging and Mental Health Survey. On the basis of the network, mental health resilience was assessed via multiple-criteria decision-making method. The most influential pollutants, vulnerable populations and strategies to increase mental health resilience were then proposed.
Air pollution exposure directly and indirectly affected mental health outcomes, defining a directional network where fine particulate matter emerged as the most influential pollutant. The mean index for short-term air pollution-associated mental health resilience was 0.52 ± 0.18. Resilience was significantly lower among females, adults aged 65-75, and less-educated individuals (mean index: 0.518 (95% CI: 0.515-0.521), 0.517 (95% CI: 0.515-0.520), and 0.516 (95% CI: 0.513-0.519), respectively). Memory lapses for sex/education disparities, irritability and feeling afraid for age disparities demonstrated the steepest disparities across demographic subgroups and bridge nodes-critical junctures that mediate resilience dynamics between populations. In terms of conditional probability, adjusting resilience factors proved more effective than merely reducing exposure.
This study has illuminated a directional network linking air pollution to mental health, with a specific focus on fine particulate matter. Thus, enhancing mental health resilience against air pollution requires a coordinated yet targeted approach, prioritizing interventions for fine particular matter exposure. Furthermore, policymakers should address resilience disparities by tailoring interventions to mitigate memory lapses (which exhibit sex/education gaps) and irritability and feeling afraid (associated with age-related vulnerabilities).</p>

<h3 id="摘要-25">摘要</h3>
<p>Plants live in close association with microbial communities that support their health and growth. Previous research has indicated that the composition of these communities can differ between genotypes of the same plant species. Host-related factors causing this variation are mostly unknown. Microbiome genes, or M genes in short, are host genes that are involved in shaping the microbiome. We hypothesized that specific M genes are responsible for microbiome variation between rice genotypes and that it is connected to plant metabolites controlled by these genes.
Our study was aimed at identifying plant metabolites driving genotype-specific microbiome assembly and establishing a link to host genetics. Targeted metabolite quantification was combined with microbiome profiling of the rice phyllosphere microbiome, association analyses on single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) level, and genetic modifications to validate microbiome-shaping effects of the discovered M genes. Targeted metabolite quantifications revealed that phenylpropanoid concentrations in rice leaves can substantially differ among 110 representative genotypes grown under the same, controlled conditions. Redundancy analyses (RDA) showed that these metabolites can explain 35.6% of the variance in their microbiomes. Further verification experiments resulted in the identification of two M genes. OsC4H2 and OsPAL06 are both plant genes with microbiome-shaping effects, mainly via their role in ferulic acid biosynthesis. Targeted gene mutation experiments confirm that distinct phyllosphere-associated bacterial groups are highly responsive to the discovered M genes.
This study provides detailed insights into the links between host genetics and microbiome variation in plants. Knowledge about host genes that are in control of the microbiome paves the way for microbiome engineering and targeted plant breeding approaches. Video Abstract.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-26">摘要</h3>
<p>Conflict invariably disrupts food production in affected areas, exacerbates food insecurity, and results in population displacement. In 2021, the invasion of the Amhara region by the Tigrayan armed group led to widespread impoverishment of much of Amhara population. The conflict particularly exacerbated malnutrition rates in the North Wollo Zone. Despite this, studies focusing on undernutrition in conflict-affected areas within the Zone have not yet been documented. Therefore, this study assessed post-conflict nutritional status of school-age children in Northeast Ethiopia.
Cross-sectional study was conducted from April to May 2022 within the community, involving 584 school-age children. Socio-demographic data was collected through a structured questionnaire, and anthropometric measurements were transformed into indices using the World Health Organization’s Anthro-software. Descriptive and analytical statistical analyses were conducted with a 95% confidence interval. A p-value of less than 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant in the multivariate regression models.
Among the 584 participants, 45.7% (95% CI: 42.0-50.0) were found to be stunted, while 33.0% (95% CI: 29.3-37.0) were classified as thin. Stunting was significantly associated with being: age 10-14 years (AOR = 6.16, 95% CI: 3.89-9.78); male (AOR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.03-2.22); having an employed father (AOR = 3.40, 95% CI: 1.46-7.92); having farmer father (AOR = 4.70, 95% CI: 2.61-8.47). The odds of thinness were significantly higher among children who were male (AOR = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.23-3.03); lived in rural areas (AOR = 2.84, 95% CI: 1.55-5.20); had a mother who was a housewife (AOR = 4.38, 95% CI: 2.09-9.18) or a merchant (AOR = 4.84, 95% CI: 1.72-13.61); had a merchant father (AOR = 14.06, 95% CI: 6.97-28.35) or employed (AOR = 11.41, 95% CI: 4.33-30.07); and lived in a food-insecure household (AOR = 6.17, 95% CI: 3.84-9.90).
Undernutrition is significant public health concern among school-age children in the conflict-affected study area. Stunting and thinness were significantly linked to factors such as the child’s sex, age, parents’ occupational status. These findings underscore the pressing need to implement health and nutrition programs aimed at enhancing the nutritional status of school-age children in the conflict-affected region.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-27">摘要</h3>
<p>Qualified clinicians previously required a practitioner waiver (i.e., “DATA-waiver” or “X-waiver”) to offer buprenorphine, a medication for opioid use disorder (OUD). However, many counties in the US experience fewer buprenorphine prescriptions due to factors such as “DATA-waiver” providers underutilizing their buprenorphine prescribing ability. Our study aimed to compare the availability of active buprenorphine-prescribing clinicians in California to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSHA)-listed DATA waived prescribers under each 5-digit ZIP Code. This study utilized the buprenorphine prescription record data in 2021 from California’s Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System (CURES). The list of the locators for all DATA-waiver clinicians was obtained from the SAMHSA webpage. Among 1,600 ZIP Codes where patients resided, 62.1% housed DATA-waived physicians, and 57.8% had active buprenorphine-prescribing clinicians. A disproportional distribution between buprenorphine-prescribing clinicians and DATA-waived physicians was evident. Among physicians listed in the SAMHSA roster, not all were actively prescribing buprenorphine. Significant disparities in access to active prescribers and DATA waiver prescribers persist between rural and urban areas in California. Addressing these issues requires resource allocation and inter-professional collaboration. The 2022 Omnibus bill’s policy changes hold promise, necessitating further effort into OUD-based policy changes.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-28">摘要</h3>
<p>Diffusion-weighted MRI is critical for diagnosing and managing ischemic stroke, but variability in images and disease presentation limits the generalizability of AI algorithms. We present DeepISLES, a robust ensemble algorithm developed from top submissions to the 2022 Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation challenge we organized. By combining the strengths of best-performing methods from leading research groups, DeepISLES achieves superior accuracy in detecting and segmenting ischemic lesions, generalizing well across diverse axes. Validation on a large external dataset (N = 1685) confirms its robustness, outperforming previous state-of-the-art models by 7.4% in Dice score and 12.6% in F1 score. It also excels at extracting clinical biomarkers and correlates strongly with clinical stroke scores, closely matching expert performance. Neuroradiologists prefer DeepISLES’ segmentations over manual annotations in a Turing-like test. Our work demonstrates DeepISLES’ clinical relevance and highlights the value of biomedical challenges in developing real-world, generalizable AI tools.

<h3 id="摘要-29">摘要</h3>
<p>Despite the benefits of early initiation of breastfeeding (EIBF) as a preventive medicine, the practice is suboptimal in West Africa (48.7 %), and there is limited systematic review evidence on the associated factors. This study aimed to aggregate the evidence on factors associated with EIBF in Anglophone and Francophone West African countries.
A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to explore the research objectives.
Six databases were searched for published studies that reported factors associated with EIBF in Anglophone and Francophone West African countries from January 1, 2008 to March 31, 2024. All relevant studies were reviewed, and odds ratios were extracted and meta-analysed.
The pooled analysis showed that caesarean section delivery in both Anglophone (AOR: 0.74; 95 % CI: 0.69, 0.81) and Francophone (AOR: 0.25; 95 % CI: 0.21, 0.30) regions, and unskilled birth attendance (AOR: 0.79; 95 % CI: 0.75, 0.83), babies perceived to be small at birth (AOR: 0.93; 95 % CI: 0.88, 0.98), rural residence (AOR: 0.89; 95 % CI: 0.85, 0.94) and mothers who wanted pregnancy now or later (AOR: 0.89; 95 % CI: 0.85, 0.92) in Anglophone regions delayed initiation of breastfeeding (DIBF). All 17 studies included were classified as medium or high quality.
Future interventions and policies to improve EIBF should focus on addressing the factors associated with DIBF, with particular emphasis on babies delivered via caesarean section. This is crucial in reducing neonatal mortalities in the region to progress towards attaining Sustainable Development Goals 2 and 3 by 2030.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-31">摘要</h3>
<p>Human milk is important for infant development, but few large studies have comprehensively investigated milk composition. Here, we characterized human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) and milk microbiota, their shaping factors, and their links to infant gut microbiota in the longitudinal Dutch Lifelines NEXT cohort. We measured 24 HMOs in 1,542 milk samples from 524 mothers at 0.5-6 months postpartum, profiled microbiota in milk and maternal and infant feces, genotyped mothers, and recorded 174 environmental, maternal, and infant characteristics. HMO concentrations were associated with maternal genetic loci (FUT2, FUT3/FUT6, ABO, and ST3GAL6), lactation stage, and subclinical mastitis. The human milk microbiota varied during lactation and with different feeding practices. Both HMOs and milk microbiota remained stable across multiple pregnancies in the same individual. Some milk bacteria were present in infant feces, but the milk and infant fecal microbiota diverged as the infant aged. Furthermore, individual HMOs were associated with infant fecal microbiota characteristics.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-32">摘要</h3>
<p>This report describes the organisation, implementation, and outcomes of the ‘Get Trained Save Lives’ (GTSL) campaign, held from 15 May to 31 July 2024, with peak activity during Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) EURO 2024 (14 June-14 July). Jointly led by the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) and UEFA, the campaign aimed to raise awareness of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) and promote cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) skills among football fans during this Mega Sport Event (MSE).
The campaign was built on four key elements: (1) self-directed online training; (2) gamified 45-minute CPR sessions for football professionals; (3) media campaigns featuring prominent footballers; and (4) live, gamified CPR training booths in Fan Zones across ten German host cities, offering hands-on practice with real-time feedback. Performance metrics were collected during these activities.
By December 2024, GTSL had engaged 183,887 individuals: 77,387 completed the full online course; 9,100 from elite football teams joined in-person training; over 40,000 engaged in Fan Zone CPR experiences; and 57,400 participated via brief interactions, satellite events, or social media. Online content reached 5 million users, with 4.7 million engagements. Gamified CPR sessions recorded a median performance score of 88/100, comparable to instructor-led outcomes.
GTSL effectively merged CPR training with edutainment and gamification, empowering football professionals and fans with lifesaving skills. Though confidence levels were not directly assessed, performance scores and participation levels showed learned CPR competences. Future MSEs can replicate this model to expand CPR awareness and improve bystander response.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-33">摘要</h3>
<p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposed rulemaking to reduce cigarette nicotine content and ban menthol in cigarettes. Menthol is popular among young adults who smoke, though it is unclear how this group would respond if both policies were implemented.
112 young adults who smoke menthol cigarettes completed three visits that varied by cigarette smoked (2021-2024): usual brand (UB) menthol, menthol very low nicotine cigarette (VLNC; 0.3mg nicotine/g tobacco), and non-menthol VLNC. VLNC flavor order was counterbalanced. Subjective response and smoking topography were assessed at each session, as well as pre-post smoking measurements of expired CO, cigarette weight, cardiovascular effects, nicotine withdrawal, and craving. Repeated measures ANOVAs were used to examine differences in the outcomes across cigarette type.
Total smoking duration, inter-puff interval (IPI), and puff count were higher for UB vs both VLNC smoking. IPI was higher in menthol (vs non-menthol) VLNC smoking. UB was more appealing than both VLNCs and lead to greater increases in CO and cardiovascular effects, and decreased post-smoking cigarette weight and craving compared to both VLNCs. Menthol (vs non-menthol) VNLCs produced more positive subjective responses, higher CO, and lower post-smoking cigarette weight, and craving.
Participants preferred menthol over non-menthol VLNCs, though VLNCs were less appealing than UB overall. Despite similar topography across VLNC flavors, toxicant exposure was greater and craving was lower after menthol (vs. non-menthol) VLNC smoking. Findings support FDA’s proposals to ban menthol cigarettes and institute market-wide reductions in cigarette nicotine content.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-34">摘要</h3>
<p>To investigate associations between hair dye use and incident uterine leiomyomata (fibroids) among Black participants from the Study of Environment, Lifestyle, and Fibroids.
Prospective cohort study.
Reproductive-aged (26-39 years) individuals with an intact uterus residing in the Detroit, Michigan area (n=868).
Self-reported hair dye use (any use vs. no use) in the previous 12 months queried on structured questionnaires.
Fibroid incidence assessed by trans-vaginal ultrasounds. We fit Cox proportional hazard models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting for age, time on study, educational attainment, annual household income, occupational status, body mass index, age at menarche, parity, use of progestin-only injectable contraceptives within the past two years, alcohol consumption, and smoking status.
One hundred and forty-nine incident fibroid cases were identified over 3,458 person-years of follow-up. After adjustment for confounders, use of any hair dye product (HR=1.44; 95% CI=0.91, 2.26) and rinses that fade (HR=1.98; 95% CI=1.04, 3.79) in the previous 12 months was associated with increased fibroid risk, compared with no use, though associations were generally imprecise.
In this cohort, use of hair dye products was modestly associated with greater fibroid risk, which has important public health implications.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-35">摘要</h3>
<p>We evaluated long COVID risk, prevalence and severity in a population-based cohort of Quebec healthcare workers (HCWs), in Canada, and the effect of reinfections, variants, and acute infection’s severity.
Retrospective survey-based cohort study conducted in Spring 2023. HCWs self-reporting COVID-19-attributed symptoms lasting ≥12 weeks were long COVID cases, classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on self-perceived symptom intensity and compared to controls. We estimated long COVID prevalence and cumulative incidence by number of infections, and following first and subsequent infections stratified by infecting variant and acute COVID-19 severity. Adjusted risk ratios were computed using robust Poisson models.
22 496 (of 397 222 invited HCWs) and 3 978 (of 10 500) participated in the electronic and telephone surveys. Long COVID cumulative risk among infected participants was 17.0% (95%CI:16.3%-17.6%), increasing with number of infections. Estimated prevalence was 5.6% (95%CI:4.9%-6.3%). Reinfections (vs. first infection), Omicron (vs. ancestral variant) and non-severe acute infection (vs. severe) were associated, respectively, with 40%, 34% and 72% lower long COVID risk. Severe cases exhibited multiple symptoms and substantial functional limitations.
Long COVID is a common and disabling condition. With the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, interventions targeting the frequency and severity of reinfections may reduce future long COVID burden.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-36">摘要</h3>
<p>This study evaluated the efficacy of horticultural therapy (HT) in improving affective symptoms and functional outcomes in individuals with depressive disorders.
A systematic search was conducted across the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, CEPS, CNKI, and Wanfang databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) implementing HT were included. Outcomes assessed included differences between HT and control groups in depression, anxiety, physical function, cognitive function, social function, and quality of life. A random-effects model was used to calculate Hedges’ g. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, and the certainty of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE approach.
Thirteen RCTs (n = 960) were included. HT significantly improved depression (g = 1.050; 95% CI: 0.663 to 1.437), anxiety (g = 0.702; 95% CI: 0.341 to 1.062), cognition (g = 0.816; 95% CI: 0.302 to 1.331), social function (g = 0.806; 95% CI: 0.295 to 1.317), and quality of life (g = 0.947; 95% CI: 0.633 to 1.260). Only one study reported improvement in physical function. Subgroup analyses revealed greater effects among inpatients with more severe baseline symptoms who received combined indoor-outdoor HT in care-providing settings for more than eight weeks. However, the certainty of evidence across outcomes ranged from very low to low due to risks of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision.
This review provides preliminary support for the efficacy of HT in depressive disorders. Given methodological limitations and potential biases, further well-designed trials with registration, blinded assessors, and long-term follow-up are warranted.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-37">摘要</h3>
<p>Researchers increasingly use online tools to advertise studies, recruit participants, and collect data, enabling access to individuals in remote or rural areas, those with limited mobility, and participants facing time constraints. While online platforms offer significant advantages, online research remains vulnerable to fraudulent activity, which can compromise the validity of study findings and deplete both funding and human resources. This special communication describes the real-world experiences of two research groups, one in Canada and one in the United States, who encountered fraudsters in both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies. We conducted a literature review and identified 32 peer-reviewed articles addressing fraudulent participation and deceptive behaviors in online research. Drawing from both our experiences and the literature, we synthesize actionable strategies to prevent, detect, and manage fraud throughout the research process, including study design (e.g. community involvement), advertisement (e.g. limited information), recruitment and screening (e.g. knowledge-based eligibility questions), assessment (e.g. embedding repeated questions), data analysis (e.g. removing fraudulent data), and remuneration (e.g. clarifying reimbursement conditions). Despite the availability of these strategies, each study design presents unique vulnerabilities, and not all approaches are universally applicable. Researchers are encouraged to assess the specific risks associated with their study design and select strategies that align with their study objectives, balancing the need to minimize fraud, recruit genuine participants, and maintain data integrity.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-38">摘要</h3>
<p>The objective was to assess the prevalence of anti-T. gondii antibodies in slaughterhouse workers in the state of Paraíba and the possible factors associated with infection by this protozoan. Blood samples were collected from 170 slaughterhouse workers from six municipalities in the state, and an epidemiological questionnaire was applied to the study participants during sample collection. The blood samples were identified, refrigerated, and sent for serological analysis using the Immunofluorescent Antibody Test (IFAT). The prevalence of anti-T. gondii IgG among workers was 77.6% (132/170; 95% CI: ±0.752), with titers ranging from 1:16 to 1:8192. Factors associated and possible consequences with infection included low education level: illiterate (PR 1.512; 95% CI 1.083-2.111); elementary education (PR 1.46; 95% CI 1.092-1.953); and difficulties in conceiving children (PR 1.23, 95% CI 1.061-1.426). We concluded that there is a high prevalence of T. gondii among slaughterhouse workers in Paraíba, and the work environment may pose a higher risk as they are directly exposed to contaminated tissues. The association between low education levels and T. gondii seropositivity reinforces the need for preventive measures and health education in the workplace.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-39">摘要</h3>
<p>Salmonella is a significant zoonotic pathogen affecting both humans and animals. Between April 2023 and May 2024, we obtained 124 Salmonella strains from 1,413 samples (8.78 %) collected from food animals in Weifang, Zibo, Heze, Taian, Linyi, Binzhou, and Jining regions of Shandong Province, China. This study aimed to analyze serovar distribution, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), antimicrobial susceptibility, and plasmid typing of isolated strains. The 124 Salmonella isolates were serotyped into 5 distinct serovars, and S. Typhimurium (58/124, 46.77 %) was the predominant serotype. MLST revealed six distinct sequence types, among which ST19 (40/124, 32.26 %) was the most common. Of the 124 isolates, 83 (66.94 %) displayed multidrug resistance, with ampicillin resistance (88/124, 70.97 %) being the most prevalent phenotype. The blaTEM gene (57/124, 45.97 %) was the most common resistance gene, followed by blaCTX-M (45/124, 36.29 %), qnrS (39/124, 31.45 %), aph(3’)-II (36/124, 29.03 %), oqxA (29/124, 23.39 %), and oqxB (28/124, 22.58 %). These Salmonella strains carried a total of six plasmid incompatibility groups, with IncFII (35/124, 28.23 %) being the most prevalent. Conjugation experiments demonstrated successful transfer of the blaTEM gene from 36 donors (36/57, 63.16 %) to Escherichia coli J53. The spread of resistance genes is largely driven by antibiotic misuse. In conclusion, controlling Salmonella prevalence and limiting antibiotic use in pigs and ducks are crucial for safeguarding public health.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-40">摘要</h3>
<p>Health status and outcomes are known to be impacted by social stressors, yet social-political change to improve health outcomes through social determinants of health is stagnant. The well understood associations between social stressors and health are often chronic in nature and are without causal evidence. A new model that demonstrates a clear cause and effect between food insecurity and accelerated tumor growth has the potential to change the way public health scientists and advocates frame their arguments for change. This model provides a novel framework for ethically sound, controllable, and translatable social determinants of health research based in objective science. Implementation of this model across other human stressors and pathologies will lay the groundwork for irrefutable evidence to support social-political change for improved health outcomes.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-41">摘要</h3>
<p>This paper explores the integral role of advocacy in pediatric surgery, a critical yet often underrepresented aspect of surgical education that influences healthcare policies, systems, and patient outcomes. Through a comprehensive review, we discuss the challenges and strategies for integrating advocacy training into pediatric surgical curricula,emphasizing experiential learning, structured mentorship, and community engagement. We highlight the unique position of pediatric surgeons in advocating for vulnerable populations, exemplified by their efforts in firearm injury prevention and healthcare accessibility. The paper underscores the need for academic institutions to foster and reward clinician-advocates by aligning advocacy with traditional academic roles and promotion criteria, ensuring that advocacy is recognized as a fundamental component of academic medicine. By embedding advocacy into the curriculum, pediatric surgeons are equipped not only to promote patient-centered care but also to drive systemic changes that improve health outcomes at a community and national level.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-42">摘要</h3>
<p>Long Covid and other infection-associated chronic condition communities have been integral in advocating for patient engagement in all stages of research, from design and conduct, and implementation, through to interpretation and knowledge translation; nevertheless, the process varies across research teams. In this paper, we (1) describe our process undertaking a community-engaged Long Covid research study; (2) evaluate our community-engaged approach, highlighting strengths and limitations with our process; and (3) identify recommendations for engaging in community-engaged patient-oriented research in Long Covid.
Guided by the 4PI (Principles; Purpose; Presence; Process; Impact) Framework and Patient-Led Research Scorecards, we describe our community-engaged approach within the Long COVID and Episodic Disability Study, followed by an evaluation of our community engagement using a multistage consultation with members of the Long COVID and Episodic Disability Study team. We conducted an online group-based discussion among persons with lived experiences and administered a web-based Scorecard questionnaire rating the collaboration as it relates to four domains of patient burden, governance, integration into the research process, and organisation readiness to all members of the team, to assess strengths and limitations of our approach. Scores ranged from -2 (non-collaboration) to +2 (ideal collaboration).
Ten team members, five of whom were persons with lived experiences, completed the Scorecard questionnaire. Median Scorecard scores ranged from +1 to +2 for all domains. Five team members with lived experiences, representing four community support groups and organisations that participated in the community-engagement discussion. We describe the practices and principles that enabled meaningful community engagement, with the strengths and limitations of our approach embedded throughout.
Our community-engaged approach to the Long COVID and Episodic Disability Study enhanced the quality and relevance of the study to the community while highlighting areas to heighten meaningful engagement throughout. This study builds on foundational community-based research principles of patient-oriented research. Recommendations derived from our experiences may be used by other research teams conducting community-engaged patient-oriented research.
The Long COVID and Episodic Disability Study is a community-engaged research study involving 25 members, including 12 persons living with long Covid, 13 researchers and 5 clinicians (categories are not mutually exclusive), referred to as the Full Team. Persons with lived experiences possessed a range of professional and personal experiences spanning research, clinical, policy and private sector/business contexts; team members wore multiple hats and perspectives which collectively strengthened the diversity of expertise, perspectives and insights to the team and process. Engagement of people with lived experiences with Long Covid ensured that the study was fully co-created with people living with Long Covid. During the development of the study proposal, community partners from organisations in Canada, Ireland, the United Kingdom and the United States, who were linked to larger networks of people living with Long Covid, were purposefully invited to join the study team. Several Long Covid community networks and organisations, represented by persons living with Long Covid, were involved in all stages of the research, including: COVID Long-Haulers Support Group Canada (S.G.); Long COVID Advocacy Ireland (I.O., S.O. and R.S.); Long COVID Ireland (N.R. and R.S.); Long COVID Physio (D.A.B. and C.T.); Long Covid Support UK (M.O.H.); and Patient-Led Research Collaborative (L.M., N.M. and H.W.). These representatives along with the Co-PIs (K.K.O. and D.A.B.) and co-ordinator (K.M.) comprised the Core Long COVID and Episodic Disability Community Collaborator Team (Core Team). Team members with lived experiences were provided yearly remuneration for their time and expertise dedicated to the study, either as an individual, or to the community organisation which they represented on the study according to their preference.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-43">摘要</h3>
<p>Respiratory diseases are associated with high mortality worldwide. Respiratory infections can lead to the emergence of chronic respiratory diseases. Scientists are constantly striving to identify new therapies with reduced side effects. The rise of antibiotic resistance and the scarcity of effective treatments further necessitate the development of novel therapeutics specific to respiratory diseases. Extensive research has been conducted on natural products that could be effective against respiratory diseases. Mangiferin, a polyphenol with a C-glycosyl xanthone structure, is a bioactive phytochemical that has potential applications in the treatment of respiratory tract infections. Mangiferin could be a therapeutic option against respiratory diseases because of its ability to target a variety of pharmacological pathways implicated in the development of these infections. It has been shown to limit infections, lower inflammation, control immune responses, and enhance host defense mechanisms. This review provides comprehensive insight into mangiferin’s potential against various respiratory disorders, focusing on its pharmacological activity and therapeutic prospects. Despite the potential of mangiferin against respiratory problems-related pathobiology, additional scientific validation through clinical trials is required before the clinical application of mangiferin in the management of respiratory diseases.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-44">摘要</h3>
<p>Mental health services often undertake codesign processes to inform and enhance service delivery, however, there continue to be many challenges undertaking codesign activities in mental health.
The aim of this study was to evaluate a codesign process undertaken for a project seeking to enhance consumer choice and satisfaction at one acute mental health inpatient setting in Melbourne, Victoria.
A five-stage codesign process evaluation was undertaken. Data collected at each stage included surveys, feedback and reflections. The data was analysed using basic data analysis and a thematic approach. Data was used for the evaluation of each stage and to inform subsequent stages. This paper describes the various activities undertaken within the codesign process which we sought to examine post hoc using the context, input, process and product (CIPP) framework.
The findings derived from the various data collection stages including the workshops and staff reflections highlighted two main foci, ‘direct experience’ and ‘the bigger picture’. First, the participants from the codesign workshops highlighted their experience including both positive experiences such as feeling heard and seen, and challenges such as having a lack of knowledge. For staff, the focus was on the bigger picture around codesign such as engaging consumers and adapting the approach as needed.
The study highlighted some of the challenges and benefits found undertaking a codesign process. In particular engagement with stakeholders required a higher level of open communication before workshops being undertaken which was important to address a power imbalance. However, the results were limited due to a lack of consumer and staff feedback. The team reflections sought to provide reasons for this limitation which was attributed to a lack of organisational readiness, stakeholder engagement, differing expectations, lack of time, and power differentials. The CIPP framework was used as a tool to undertake a post hoc evaluation of this complex codesign process undertaken.
Codesign processes will continue to grow as the preferred method of ensuring mental health services meet the needs to the community. The CIPP framework is one means of ensuring that codesign processes follow a systematic, iterative approach to appropriately meet those needs. Future projects within mental health settings should consider the inclusion of consumers, carers and non-lived experience staff members, as a project team, to offer differing views. In addition, project success often relies on organisational readiness and the ability to reflect on and address power. We conclude that a restorative practice approach to create more open dialogue and communication before commencement of codesign projects may be a key solution.
The authors would like to thank and acknowledge the consumers with a lived experience, carers, and mental health care staff who participated in the codesign process. This paper was written by consumers, carers, staff and academics who were involved in the project.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-45">摘要</h3>
<p>Food insecurity is the limited availability of nutritionally adequate foods. It affects 9 % of households where children live. Food insecurity can lead to multiple health problems throughout the lifespan of a child. Many hospital systems have undertaken initiatives to increase the intake of nutritious foods to prevent and alleviate these health problems. Additionally, there are federal programs such as SNAP, WIC and NSLP that work to lessen food insecurity in children. Pediatric surgeons should screen their patients for food insecurity. They should partner with their health system to create programs that alleviate food insecurity in patients. Finally, pediatric surgeons should advocate for policy changes to reduce the incidence of food insecurity.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-46">摘要</h3>
<p>Since emerging in China in 2010, Duck Tembusu Virus (DTMUV) has caused substantial economic losses to the poultry industry. Guangdong province, a major hub for waterfowl farming and consumption in China, has been severely impacted by DTMUV. Investigating the epidemiology and genetic diversity of DTMUV in Guangdong is essential for developing effective prevention and control strategies. In this study, we collected 427 goose liver samples from five geographically distinct regions in Guangdong province. DTMUV RNA was detected in 69 samples, with positive rates ranging from 12.9 % to 18.6 % in the regions. Eight complete genome sequences were subsequently amplified, and genetic analyses revealed that these strains clustered into three distinct subclades (2.1.1, 2.2, and 3.2), indicating significant genetic heterogeneity among DTMUV circulating in Guangdong’s goose populations. Furthermore, a statistically supported recombination event was identified in one strain, underscoring the role of genetic recombination in driving viral diversity. These findings enhance our understanding of DTMUV’s genetic diversity and evolutionary dynamics in goose populations, thereby providing critical insights into its transmission patterns and evolutionary trends in Guangdong province, China.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-47">摘要</h3>
<p>Animal bites, particularly from domestic cats, represent a significant public health concern, accounting for a substantial number of emergency room visits annually. However, osteomyelitis of the metacarpal bone following a cat bite is a rare and underreported complication which presents unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. A 35-year-old male patient developed metacarpal osteomyelitis following a housecat bite, despite receiving early empirical antibiotic therapy. Unlike conventional osteomyelitis, cat bite-related osteomyelitis can progress insidiously due to rapid wound closure, creating an anaerobic environment that fosters deep-seated infection. This case underscores the importance of early radiological evaluation, aggressive surgical debridement, and prolonged targeted antibiotic therapy in managing such infections. In conclusion, the report highlights the need for heightened clinical suspicion and tailored management strategies to prevent delayed diagnosis and complications in similar cases.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-48">摘要</h3>
<p>This study aims to assess the incidence and risk factors for avascular necrosis (AVN) in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) under modern immunosuppression.
Between January 1993 and April 2023, a total of 769 KTRs (496 males, 273 females; mean age: 38.15±12.29 years) who underwent transplantation were retrospectively analyzed. The diagnosis of AVN was established using X-rays and magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate patients presenting with pain in one or more joints. Risk factors for AVN were analyzed in a cohort of 290 transplant recipients after 2007 under tacrolimus-based treatment to standardize immunosuppression (178 males, 112 females; mean age: 40.6±12.0 years).
The incidence of AVN was 8.2% (n=21) from 1993 to 2007 and 4.1% (n=21) from 2008 to 2023, retrospectively. The median duration from transplantation to the diagnosis of AVN was 15 (range, 1 to 68) months, with the femoral head being the predominant site affected. The reduction in AVN incidence, along with the replacement of cyclosporine by tacrolimus and the reduction in total corticosteroid dosage, was evident in recent era. The increased body mass index (BMI) (p=0.005), the onset of late acute rejection (p=0.024), and the administration of greater cumulative corticosteroid doses at both three (p=0.001) and 12 months (p&lt;0.001) were correlated with the incidence of AVN in recipients undergoing tacrolimus-based maintenance immunosuppression. Multivariate analysis indicated that an elevated BMI (odds ratio [OR]=1.130, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.013-1.261; p=0.028) and a cumulative methylprednisolone dosage exceeding 4.5 g within 12 months (OR=12.692, 95% CI: 2.146-75.069; p=0.005) were significant predictors of AVN.
The incidence of AVN in kidney transplant recipients has significantly diminished in the modern immunosuppressive era and the elevated total corticosteroid dosage remains the principal risk factor for AVN among kidney transplant recipients. The implementation of preventive strategies and screening in high-risk populations should be coordinated between transplant specialists and orthopedic surgeons.</p>

<p>In this study, we aimed to investigate whether there was a relationship between deformity at the fracture line/eccentric placement of the nail, and union time (UT) in isthmal diaphyseal femoral fractures treated with intramedullary nails.
Between September 2017 and December 2020, a total of 61 patients (38 males, 23 females; median age: 47 years; range, 23 to 62 years) with closed femoral shaft fractures who underwent antegrade nailing were retrospectively analyzed. The following parameters were examined: (i) amount of angulation in the fracture line (AFL), (ii) varus/valgus of the fracture line (VAFL), (iii) amount of deviation of the distal tip of the nail from the femoral notch (DDT), (iv) medial lateral orientation of the distal nail relative to the notch (MLON), (v) number of fracture parts (NFP), and (vi) UT.
The causes of injury were high-velocity traffic accidents in 42 patients and falls in 19 patients. The median surgical delay was 4.5 (range, 2 to 8 days). The median follow-up time was 37 (range, 12 to 57) months. There was a moderate, statistically significant and positive correlation between UT and AFL, DDT, and NFP (r=0.486, p&lt;0.001). The difference in UT according to MLON (p=0.002) was statistically significant.
Our study results suggest that impaired weight-bearing force and translational force may cause impaired healing. Thus, angulation of the fracture line and eccentric nail placement may delay fracture union. We recommend using bold screws to ensure that there is no deformity in the fracture line and to fully center the nail inside the distal bone.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-50">摘要</h3>
<p>Women face a higher risk of musculoskeletal disorders, particularly during and after pregnancy, due to complex hormonal and biomechanical changes. Pregnancy-associated hormonal fluctuations, primarily involving estrogen, progesterone, and relaxin, contribute to increased joint laxity, altered collagen dynamics, and ligamentous instability. Simultaneously, anatomical adaptations, including shifts in the center of gravity, increased lumbar lordosis, and altered gait mechanics, further strain the musculoskeletal system. These changes predispose pregnant women to conditions such as low back pain, pelvic girdle dysfunction, hip pathologies, and peripheral neuropathies, significantly impacting daily function and quality of life. While many of those disorders resolve postpartum, their long-term effects remain inadequately studied, raising concerns about potential chronic musculoskeletal complications, including osteoarthritis and persistent joint instability. Despite the prevalence of these conditions, there is a lack of standardized, evidence-based clinical pathways for assessment, early intervention, and postpartum rehabilitation. Current management strategies tend to focus on short-term symptomatic relief, such as analgesic use and activity modification, while often overlooking preventive strategies like routine musculoskeletal screening during prenatal visits, structured exercise programs tailored to pregnancy, and postpartum rehabilitation protocols. A well-tailored interdisciplinary collaboration is critical to address this gap. Obstetricians are well-positioned to identify early signs of musculoskeletal problems and initiate referrals. Physiatrists can develop and implement nonpharmacological treatment plans, including therapeutic exercise, physical therapy, and posture correction. They are also able to initiate targeted injections for musculoskeletal problems. Orthopedic surgeons provide expertise in diagnosing and managing structural abnormalities or persistent biomechanical dysfunction. Together, these disciplines can design comprehensive, longitudinal care models that prioritize both prevention and recovery. Research is still needed to delineate the long-term consequences of pregnancy on the musculoskeletal system and to establish preventive measures that enhance maternal health beyond the perinatal period. In this review, we address this gap by providing a comprehensive discussion regarding the effects of pregnancy and hormonal changes on the musculoskeletal system, as well as the commonplace conditions in daily clinical practice.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-51">摘要</h3>
<p>This study aims to investigate the association between the preoperative Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) score and two important postoperative outcomes, surgical site infection (SSI) and prolonged hospital stay, in patients aged 60 years and older undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
Between February 2019 and December 2023, a total of 268 patients (54 males, 214 females; mean age: 68.2±5.9 years; range, 60 to 87 years) aged ≥60 years who underwent elective primary TKA were retrospectively analyzed. The nutritional status was assessed using the CONUT score, and patients were categorized as at nutritional risk (CONUT ≥2) or normal (CONUT 0-1). Primary outcomes were postoperative infection and length of hospitalization. Multivariate logistic regression was used to adjust for confounding variables including age, body mass index (BMI), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, Visual Analog Scale (VAS), hemoglobin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and surgery duration.
Of the patients, 27.2% (n=73) were at nutritional risk. These patients had significantly higher rates of postoperative infection (11% vs. 3.1%, p=0.010) and longer hospital stays (5.5±1.7 vs. 1.5±0.5 days, p&lt;0.001). A higher CONUT score was independently associated with increased risk of infection (adjusted odds ratio [OR]=4.12; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.33-12.7; p=0.014) and prolonged hospitalization (adjusted OR=4.03; 95% CI: 3.75-4.30; p&lt;0.001).
The CONUT score is a valuable tool for preoperative risk assessment in TKA. High CONUT scores are associated with an increased risk of postoperative infection and prolonged hospitalization. Routine nutritional assessment using the CONUT score prior to surgery in older adults may help improve surgical outcomes, reduce complications and lower healthcare costs.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-52">摘要</h3>
<p>This study aims to evaluate 30-day postoperative complications and hospital readmissions across different body mass index (BMI) categories and diabetic statuses following primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
Between January 2013 and December 2022, a total of 502 patients (100 males, 402 females; mean age: 68.8±7.7 years; range, 45 to 91 years) who underwent primary TKA for knee osteoarthritis were retrospectively analyzed. Data collected included basic demography, BMI, diabetes mellitus (DM) status, and 30-day postoperative complications such as venous thromboembolism (VTE), infections, neurological events, cardiac events, and renal issues. Readmissions due to operative or medical complications were recorded.
Of the patients, 141 (28.1%) had DM and 186 (37.1%) patients were classified as obese. The obese group experienced the highest incidence of VTE (1.6%), whereas overweight patients exhibited a higher rate of renal events (1.0%). All non-diabetic underweight patients (n=2) developed postoperative hypoglycemia. Diabetic patients had significantly increased odds of VTE compared to non-diabetics (odds ratio=6.74; p=0.009). Normal BMI diabetic patients demonstrated the highest incidence of surgical site infections (7.4%), while normal BMI non-diabetic patients were more prone to foot drop (1.1%) and cardiac events (4.5%).
Elevated BMI and DM independently or in combination, contribute to higher rates of postoperative complications and readmissions following TKA.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-53">摘要</h3>
<p>This study aims to evaluate the hidden blood loss (HBL) and its possible risk factors after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) with zero-profile anchored spacer (ZPAS) in patients with cervical radiculopathy.
Between January 2017 and January 2024, a total of 92 patients (44 males, 48 females; mean age: 73.2±10.0 years; range, 44 to 85 years) who underwent ACDF with ZPAS were retrospectively analyzed. Data collection encompassed baseline demographics including age, sex, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), disease duration, symptomatic laterality, and comorbidities and perioperative parameters such as the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, operative levels, surgical time, intraoperative blood loss, and postoperative drainage volume. The HBL was quantified using the Sehat formula. Subsequent multivariate linear regression modeling was employed to identify independent predictors of HBL.
The mean surgical time was 152.6±27.6 min. The mean total blood loss (TBL) and HBL were 334.6±67.7 mL and 268.1±69.0 mL, respectively. Correlation analyses revealed significant associations between HBL and symptomatic laterality, hematocrit (Hct) loss, surgical levels, and surgical time (p&lt;0.05). Multivariate linear regression further confirmed Hct loss, surgical levels, and surgical time as positive predictors of HBL (p&lt;0.05).
Patients with cervical radiculopathy who underwent ACDF with ZPAS perioperatively had significant HBL. More Hct loss, more surgical levels, and longer surgical time were independent risk factors for increased HBL.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-54">摘要</h3>
<p>This study aims to investigate the predictive value of the Hemoglobin, Albumin, Lymphocyte, and Platelet (HALP) score for six-month mortality in patients undergoing hemiarthroplasty for femoral neck fractures (FNFs).
Between March 2019 and March 2022, a total of 60 patients (32 males, 28 females; mean age: 83.2±6.3 years; range, 67 to 95 years) who underwent hemiarthroplasty for FNFs were retrospectively analyzed. Complete blood count and albumin levels were analyzed in venous blood samples at the time of hospital admission. The neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte/lymphocyte ratio (MLR), platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR), prognostic nutritional index (PNI), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), and HALP scores were calculated. The six-month mortality rates of the patients were recorded.
At six-month follow-up, 22 (36.6%) patients died and 38 (63.4%) survived. In logistic regression analysis, only HALP score was found to be associated with six-month mortality independently of other parameters (p=0.001 odds ratio [OR]=1.09, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06-1.13). The six-month survival increased 1.09-fold for each unit increase in HALP score. In the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis, the HALP score showed 71.1% sensitivity and 72.7% specificity using a cut-off value of 19.95 (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.804, 95% CI: 0.687-0.921).
Our study results show that low HALP score is associated with six-month mortality in this patient group. Based on these findings, we suggest that the clinical use of the HALP score as a prognostic marker in hip fracture patients.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-55">摘要</h3>
<p>In this meta-analysis, we discuss the complication rates of conversion to total hip arthroplasty (cTHA) following failed internal fixation (IF) of femoral neck fractures (FNFs) versus primary total hip arthroplasty (pTHA).
The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, and Science Direct databases were searched for eligible publications published prior to December 2024. The search terms included “femoral neck fracture”, “internal fixation failure”, and “total hip arthroplasty”. The mean difference (MD) and risk difference (RD) were used as combined variables, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were chosen.
Six non-randomized-controlled clinical trials comprising 1,301 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled data revealed statistically significant differences in postoperative deep infection rates (RD=0.04; 95% CI: 0.01- 0.08; p=0.009), periprosthetic fractures (RD=0.03; 95% CI: 0.00-0.05; p=0.03), and reoperation rates (RD=0.07; 95% CI: 0.03-0.11; p=0.0002) between the cTHA and pTHA groups. However, no significant differences were observed in the incidence of postoperative dislocations (RD=0.05; 95% CI: -0.03-0.13; p=0.19), deep vein thrombosis (RD= -0.01; 95% CI: -0.04-0.03; p=0.77), superficial infections (RD=0.02; 95% CI: -0.02-0.06; p=0.37), or revision surgeries (RD=0.02; 95% CI: -0.01-0.05; p=0.13).
Compared to pTHA, cTHA following failed IF of FNFs was associated with higher deep infection, periprosthetic fractures, and reoperation rates.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-56">摘要</h3>
<p>In our study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic ozone therapy (OT) for heterotopic ossification (HO) development after hip surgery in a rat model.
We randomly divided a total of 20 Wistar albino rats into two equal groups (n=10) as the control group (Group 1) receiving daily intraperitoneal injections of 1 mL of Ringer’s lactate solution for a duration of two weeks after undergoing hip surgery and the group (Group 2) receiving OT daily at a dose of 1 mL of an ozone/oxygen combination via intraperitoneal route for a period of two weeks after hip surgery. Hip surgery was performed to mimic the formation of HO. After 12 weeks, the animals were evaluated functionally and sacrificed. Following sacrification, histopathological, and radiological assessments were performed.
The modified Brooker staging method was used for radiological evaluation, and all animals in the control group showed at least Stage 1 HO formation. However, only three animals (30%) in the OT group showed HO formation (p=0.006). In histopathological evaluation, the median HO rates in the high power field were 42.5 (range, 30 to 55) in the control group and 0 (range, 0 to 25) in the OT group (p=0.003), and the median leukocyte count was 5.5 (range, 3 to 7) in the control group and 1 (range, 0 to 3) in the ozone group (p=0.006). Radiological HO, histopathological HO, and inflammation were significantly lower in the ozone group (p&lt;0.05).
Our study results suggest that OT is effective in decreasing HO formation in rats following hip surgery.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-57">摘要</h3>
<p>This study aims to explore the prevalence of neuropathic pain (NP) in patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA) and to assess its correlation with functional status.
Between December 2023 and May 2024, a total of 193 patients (48 males, 145 females; mean age: 58.7±12.8 years; range, 22 to 89 years) who were diagnosed with KOA and had persistent knee pain for more than three months were included. The painDETECT and Douleur Neuropathique en 4 Questions (DN4) questionnaires were utilized to evaluate NP. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used to assess pain severity, while the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) was utilized to assess functional status.
The painDETECT indicated NP in 27.5% of patients, while the DN4 scale showed 30.6%. Patients with NP exhibited significantly elevated VAS and WOMAC scores to patients without NP, indicating a greater severity of pain and functional impairment in this subgroup (p&lt;0.05). The agreement between the painDETECT and DN4 was moderate (κ=0.472). There were significant correlations between the painDETECT and DN4 scores with the WOMAC total score (r=0.371 and r=0.242, respectively, p&lt;0.001).
Neuropathic pain is common in KOA patients and is associated with higher pain intensity and poorer functional outcomes. The moderate agreement between the painDETECT and DN4 scores may lead to a certain degree of diagnostic variation. Combining more than one method may increase the diagnostic accuracy.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-58">摘要</h3>
<p>The relationship between benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and the oxidative balance score (OBS) will be discussed in this study.
The clinical data on 16 dimensions of diet and 4 dimensions of lifestyle from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2001 to 2008 were used to calculate OBS. We considered BPH as the outcome and investigated the linear and nonlinear relationships between the two. Additionally, subgroup analyses and interaction tests were conducted as well. Furthermore, the methods of machine learning including XGBoost, support vector machine (SVM) and naive Bayes (NB) were used to establish a predictive model for BPH.
Higher OBS was consistently associated with an increased prevalence of BPH, with Restricted Cubic Splines highlighting a significant positive nonlinear association (P=0.015). Subgroup analyses revealed differences and interactive relationships based on alcohol consumption. Among the seven machine learning models that we included the OBS score in, the XGBoost model emerged as the best, with an AUC value of 0.769.
There is a significant association between OBS and the prevalence of BPH in the American population, which provides a valuable insight for further diagnosis and research of the disease.</p>

<p>Miao medicine is guided by the medical theories of the Miao ethnic group, and the drugs used by the Miao people are derived from natural plants and animals for the prevention and treatment of diseases and protection of health. In recent years, a large number of clinical studies have shown good clinical efficacy of traditional Miao medicine in the treatment of prostatic diseases, with the advantages of easy availability, low price, and minimal adverse reactions. However, currently no systematic literature review has been reported on the treatment of prostatic diseases with Miao medicine. This article focuses on the commonly used Miao drugs recorded in the Chinese Materia Medica－Miao Medicine, with a systematic review of relevant literature retrieved on the treatment of prostate diseases with Miao medicine in recent years and a summarization of the advances in the studies of its pharmacological effects, mechanisms of action and clinical application, aiming to provide some new perspectives and ideas for further academic research and clinical development of Miao medicine.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-60">摘要</h3>
<p>To investigate the protective effect of achyranthes bidentata (AB) on sperm quality in mice with spermatogenic disorder through the glycolytic metabolic pathway and its action mechanism.
We equally randomized 40 Kunming mice into a normal control, a model control, a low-dose AB (3.5 g/kg) and a high-dose AB group (7.0 g/kg), and established the model of spermatogenic disorder in the latter three groups of mice by intraperitoneal injection of doxorubicin (30 mg/kg). Two days after modeling, we collected the testis and kidney tissues and blood samples from the mice for observation of the pathological changes in the testis tissue by HE staining, detection of perm motility with the sperm quality analyzer, examination of the apoptosis of testis cells by flow cytometry, measurement of the levels of testosterone (T), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in the serum and testis tissue by ELISA, and determination of expressions of the key enzymes of glycolysis hexokinase Ⅱ (HK2), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), platelet phosphofructokinase (PFKP), lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) and the meiosis proteins REC8 and SCP3 by Western blot, and the mRNA expressions of glycolytic phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK1), phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) by fluorescence quantitative PCR (FQ-PCR).
Compared with the model controls, the mice in the AB groups showed significant increases in the testis coefficient, kidney index, sperm concentration, sperm motility, spermatogonia, primary spermatocytes, spermatids, sperm count and the serum T level (P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01), but dramatic decreases in the apoptosis of testis cells and percentage of morphologically abnormal sperm (P&lt;0.01). Achyranthes bidentata also significantly elevated the levels of SOD and CAT, and down-regulated the mRNA expressions of MDA, TNF-α and IL-1β (P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01), and up-regulated the protein expressions of HK2, PKM2, PFKP, LDHA, REC8 and SCP3, and expressions of the glycolysis key genes Pfk1 and Pgk1 (P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01).
Achyranthes bidentata ameliorates doxorubicin-induced spermatogenic disorder in mice by regulating the glycolytic pathway and reducing oxidative stress and the expressions of inflammatory factors.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-61">摘要</h3>
<p>Despite the well-documented benefits of physical activity, particularly strength training, for managing menopause-related physiological changes such as muscle loss and weight gain, few interventions specifically target pre- and perimenopausal women using scalable, remote delivery methods.
The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a group-based physical activity and strength intervention delivered via Zoom for pre- and perimenopausal women.
This study was a randomized controlled trial lasting 12 weeks.
Low active pre- and perimenopausal women between the ages of 40-50 (n = 39) were randomly assigned to a 12-week physical activity strength intervention or a waitlist control. Participants attended the sessions twice per week, which included both a 40-min cardiovascular and strength training component and a 20-min motivational component informed by Self-Determination Theory and Habit Formation Theory. Participants were provided Apple Watch devices to monitor their physical activity.
The physical activity strength intervention appears feasible based on recruitment duration, adherence to the Zoom sessions, retention, and the consumer satisfaction survey. The intervention participants increased their physical activity by 21 min/week, and the control group decreased by 2 min, although the differences were not significant. The intervention participants reported greater positive changes on several of the psychosocial variables, including self-efficacy, habit formation, habit automaticity, self-regulation, goal setting, physical activity enjoyment, physical activity feeling, physical activity revitalization, and physical activity tranquility.
Although there was no evidence that the intervention led to increases in physical activity, this study supports the feasibility of a group-based physical activity strength intervention delivered via Zoom. Additional studies that include larger sample sizes and a longer intervention are needed to better understand the efficacy of the intervention.Registration/clinical trials: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05426070.
The group-based physical activity and strength intervention delivered via Zoom was found to be feasible for premenopausal women. Additional studies including large sample sizes are neededThe majority of physical activity intervention studies do not adequately integrate strength training. This is particularly problematic for women approaching menopause given menopause is often related to weight gain and loss of muscle.
The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a group-based physical activity and strength intervention delivered via Zoom for premenopausal women.
This study was a single blind randomized controlled trial lasting 12 weeks.
Low active premenopausal women between the ages of 40–50 (n = 39) were randomly assigned to a 12-week physical activity strength intervention or a waitlist control. The sessions included a 40 min cardiovascular and strength training component and a 20 min motivational component informed by Self-Determination Theory and Habit Formation Theory. Participants were provided Apple Watch devices to monitor their physical activity.
The physical activity strength intervention appears feasible based on recruitment duration, adherence to the Zoom sessions, retention, and the consumer satisfaction survey. There were no differences between the groups on physical activity, however, intervention participants reported greater positive changes on several of the psychosocial variables including self-efficacy, habit formation, habit automaticity, self-regulation, goal setting, physical activity enjoyment, physical activity feeling, physical activity revitalization, and physical activity tranquility.
This study supports the feasibility of a group-based physical activity strength intervention delivered via Zoom. Additional studies that include larger sample sizes and a longer intervention are needed to better understand the efficacy of the intervention.</p>
