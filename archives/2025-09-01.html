<h2 id="article-1">1. Risk factors of linezolid-associated hyponatremia from a retrospective case-control study: decreased serum albumin as a selective predictor in elder patients.</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: Annals of medicine
<strong>发表日期</strong>: 2025-Dec
<strong>链接</strong>: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40886330">PubMed</a></p>

<h3 id="摘要">摘要</h3>
<p>The incidence of linezolid-associated hyponatremia is approximately 20% in real-world studies. However, there are limited case reports and rare research on linezolid-induced hyponatremia. This study aims to identify risk factors associated with linezolid-induced hyponatremia, particularly in older patients.
This retrospective study was conducted from January 2018 to December 2023. Patients aged over 18 years who received linezolid for at least three days at Beijing Hospital were included. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics version 19.
68 patients were identified in the hyponatremia group, with 68 matched individuals by sex and age in the control group. Binary logistic regression analysis revealed that a history of cardiovascular disease, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and the duration of linezolid therapy were risk factors for hyponatremia. Subgroup analysis in patients age ≥ 65 identified the duration of therapy, a history of cardiovascular disease, a history of endocrine diseases, and serum albumin (ALB) decreased during linezolid therapy as key indicators of hyponatremia.
A decrease in ALB during linezolid therapy is a more selective predictor of hyponatremia than baseline ALB. Linezolid-induced hyponatremia is associated with adverse outcomes, highlighting the importance of monitoring serum sodium and ALB in patients receiving this therapy.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-1">摘要</h3>
<p>Dose accuracy in radiotherapy is crucial for treatment outcomes and patient safety. Ensuring dose accuracy allows for effective targeting of tumors while protecting surrounding healthy tissues. The quality assurance programs implemented worldwide by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) are among the most effective methods to enhance dose reliability, particularly in developing countries.
This study aims to comprehensively evaluate the reliability of treatment doses applied in radiotherapy centers across Türkiye and to determine the impact of national dose control processes.
The study, thoroughly analyzes dose accuracy in public, private, and university hospitals across six geographical regions of Türkiye. The study investigates whether the treatment doses administered by these centers comply with internationally accepted limits using the IAEA/WHO thermoluminescent dosimetry (TLD) audit standards. In these audits, the accuracy and consistency of the doses applied by each center were evaluated and compared with international standards.
Among the 34 participating centers, 6% achieved dose deviations within ±1%, while 68% were within the widely accepted ±5% tolerance range. Notably, 26% of the centers exhibited deviations in the ±4%-5% band. Differences in dose accuracy were observed between center types and geographical regions. These results provide a snapshot of national performance and highlight areas for quality improvement. The results indicate that while dose reliability in Türkiye is generally within acceptable limits, deviations in some regions suggest the need for further standardization among centers.
These findings underscore the importance of sustainable dose control processes at the national level and highlight their role in improving the quality of radiotherapy services in Türkiye. The study emphasizes that future dose calibration programs and training will further enhance dose accuracy across the country, contributing to safe and effective treatment for patients.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-2">摘要</h3>
<p>Previous studies demonstrated that diabetes and hyperglycemia promote cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) progression, in vitro and in vivo. However, the predictive abilities of blood glucose levels for CCA prognosis remain unclear. This retrospective cohort analysis included 85 patients with histologically confirmed CCA at Srinagarind Hospital, Khon Kaen University, between 1998 and 2000, comprised 57 males and 28 females with a median age of 56 ± 13 years. The glucose-lymphocyte ratio (GLR) was calculated from preoperative fasting blood glucose and absolute lymphocyte counts, and the cutoff was determined using the receiver operating characteristic curve. Survival analysis revealed that higher GLR was significantly associated with shorter overall survival (P &lt; 0.05). A higher GLR was negatively correlated with total protein, globulin, and lymphocyte counts (P &lt; 0.05). Univariate analysis revealed that a high GLR was associated with male sex and a survival time &lt; 6 months (P &lt; 0.05). The multivariable Cox proportional hazard model showed that a higher GLR was an independent prognostic factor for CCA (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.887; 95% confidence interval: 1.101-3.237), alongside carbohydrate antigen 19-9, staging, neutrophil count, and histological grading. Collectively, these findings indicate that the GLR is a significant prognostic biomarker for CCA, underscoring the importance of metabolic and nutritional status in CCA management.</p>

<p>A légúti óriássejtes vírus (respiratory syncytial virus – RSV) a gyermekkor egyik legfontosabb, alsó légúti fertőzést okozó kórokozója, amely idősebb felnőttek és immunszupprimáltak körében is jelentős morbiditási és mortalitási tényező. Bár az RSV már a COVID–19-világjárvány előtt is jól ismert patogén volt, a korábban jellemző őszi–téli szezonális járványok karakterisztikája az elmúlt években jelentősen megváltozott, számottevő többletterhet róva az ellátórendszerre. Több évtizedes kutatások ellenére eddig nem állt rendelkezésre széles körben alkalmazható prevenciós vagy terápiás intervenció, és csak a közelmúltban jelentek meg olyan hatékony immunizációs stratégiák, amelyek áttörést jelentenek a súlyos fertőzés és szövődményeinek megelőzésében. Jelen összefoglaló közleményünk átfogó irodalomkutatás alapján áttekintést nyújt az RSV ellen jelenleg elérhető vakcinációs armamentumról, különös tekintettel a legfrissebb eredményekre, klinikai vizsgálatokra és az alkalmazás gyakorlati kérdéseire, a nemzetközi irányelvek és javaslatok figyelembevételével. A közelmúlt áttörései közé tartozik egy hosszú hatású monoklonális antitest (nirsevimab), valamint az anyai immunizáció kifejlesztése, amelyek célja a passzív immunitás biztosítása az újszülöttek számára. Emellett az idősebb felnőttek számára több új RSV-vakcina is ígéretes hatékonyságot mutat a súlyos megbetegedések megelőzésében. Ezek a mérföldkövek paradigmaváltást jelentenek a tüneti kezelésre alapozó eszközkészletből a megelőzés irányába, aminek fényében különösen fontos, hogy a nemzeti egészségpolitikai döntéshozók mihamarabb mérlegeljék az RSV elleni immunizációs stratégiák bővítését és hosszú távon fenntartható bevezetését.

<h3 id="摘要-4">摘要</h3>
<p>Technological advances and widely spread screening programs enabled the discovery of ever smaller lesions. As such, in the last years, the tendency has shifted towards lung-sparing procedures. The role of limited surgical excision for small peripheral nodules is currently a topic of heated debate.
In our work, we try to answer whether the segmentectomy could adequately treat the peripheral NSCLC staged as Tis/1a-bN0M0.
Our analysis is a single-center retrospective study based on the 8-year experience of our department. We identified 73 lobectomy patients and 16 segmentectomy patients. However, the lack of similarity between the two groups made it inadequate to draw satisfactory conclusions, therefore we reduced the lobectomy group and selected only those patients who could be paired with corresponding patients in the segmentectomy group. The established parameters of similarity were age (weighted at 15%), size of the lesion (50%), and follow-up (35%), and the input values were normalized. With this method, we could compare two samples of the most similar patients. 32 cases were included in the final analysis. The inclusion criteria were: NSCLC histology, size up to 2 cm, no visceral pleura invasion, N0 disease, and performed segmentectomy or lobectomy between Jan/2015 and Dec/2022. We analyzed the disease-free time and relapse rate.
Data refers to a total of 32 patients distributed in two groups: group A with 16 segmentectomies (S6, S1+2 or S1) and group B with 16 lobectomies. The mean time of follow-up was 30 months (1-85) for group A and 32 months (1-91) for group B. The disease-free survival was 27 months for group A and 31 months for group B. The relapse rate was 19% for segmentectomies and 12.5% for lobectomies.
In conclusion, while this article presents our center’s experience with segmentectomy, we believe further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to establish its non-inferiority. Nevertheless, our experience indicates that segmentectomy offers significant benefits, including lung preservation and the potential for future resections.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-5">摘要</h3>
<p>Tracheal surgery is a specialized field in which many disciplines work jointly due to the variety of indications and the extended topography. The main indications for surgery include inflammatory (generally post-intubation), congenital or post-traumatic stenoses, benign or malignant neoplasms and tracheal lacerations, whether iatrogenic or traumatic. The purpose of this study is to review the management of one institution’s approach to a wide variety of tracheal lesions over the last 10 years.
We retrospectively analyzed data of all subjects submitted to tracheal surgery in our center, between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2023. The preoperative and postoperative data were retrospectively evaluated through the consultation of the clinical files and the computer registry system.
We included 24 patients, mean age of 53 years (min 19; max 87), 54% being female. The most frequent indication for surgery was post-intubation tracheal stenosis (16, 67%) followed by tracheal laceration (6, 25%) and pleomorphic adenoma of the trachea (2, 8%). The mean operative time was 148 minutes (min: 80; max. 205). The mean tracheal length resected was 2,14 cm (min: 1; max: 3,2). Postoperative complications included: vocal cord paralysis (2, 8%), surgical wound site infection (2, 8%), anastomotic dehiscence (1, 4%) and mediastinitis (1, 4%). Re-stenosis occurred in 1 patient who was treated with prosthesis placement via bronchoscopy and 1 patient required definitive tracheostomy due to vocal cord paresis. Median chin stitch duration and median length of stay was 10 and 15 days, respectively. In-hospital mortality was 8% (2 cases). Overall mortality during mean follow-up time (51 months) was 8% (2 cases).
Tracheal surgery seems a valid and safe technique in selected patients and can be performed safely with low morbidity and mortality, according to our center results.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-6">摘要</h3>
<p>Peripheral artery disease, a manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis, often necessitates surgical revascularization in advanced stages, with femoropopliteal bypass serving as a primary intervention to restore adequate lower limb perfusion. When autologous vein grafts are not available, prosthetic conduits are commonly used. However, these heterologous materials carry an increased risk of infectious complications, which, although rare, are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. This study aims to review the current literature on prosthetic graft infections in femoropopliteal bypass surgeries, focusing on epidemiology, risk factors, microbiology, diagnostic methods, treatment strategies, and preventive measures.
A narrative review of the literature was conducted using databases such as PubMed to identify relevant studies on vascular prosthetic infections, particularly in femoropopliteal bypass surgeries.
Prosthetic graft infections occur in approximately 2.6% of femoropopliteal bypass surgeries. Staphylococcus epidermidis is the most commonly isolated pathogen. Other relevant Gram-positive bacteria include Staphylococcus aureus, and Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Accurate identification of the etiological agent through microbiological and diagnostic methods is essential for improving clinical outcomes. Early diagnosis is crucial to enable timely and effective treatment, which generally combines antibiotic therapy with surgical intervention, often necessitating graft removal. Furthermore, adopting preventive measures, such as perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis, is fundamental to reducing the incidence of these complications and minimizing the morbidity and mortality associated with prosthetic graft infections.
Prosthetic graft infections in femoropopliteal bypass surgeries remain a challenging complication. A multidisciplinary approach encompassing early detection, evidence-based treatment, and targeted prevention strategies is essential to improve outcomes, preserve limb function, and mitigate long-term morbidity.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-7">摘要</h3>
<p>This pilot study investigated the potential impact of using orogastric tube (OGT) on the immediate post- operative outcomes in adult patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft procedures.
A prospective non-blinded randomised study.
At a single University Hospital.
Seventy-eight consecutive adult patients that underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery were included.
Thirty-nine patients received an OGT, and thirty-nine patients did not (control group).
Primary outcomes included: the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, opiate use for pain, prolonged ventilation, and gastric dilatation on x-ray. Secondary outcomes included: the incidence of major adverse cardiac and cerebral events, major respiratory, gastrointestinal, and renal complications, and total hospital length of stay.
There were non-significant trends towards higher incidence of post-operative nausea (n=2/39; 5.1%; p=0.156) and vomiting (n=1/39; 2.6%, p=0.314) in the OGT group compared to the non-OGT group (n = 0). There was a significant increase in opiates use for pain in the OGT group (n = 13/39; 33.3%) compared to the non-OGT group (n = 3/39, 7.7%) (p=0.0054), indicating that OGT may contribute to the development of postoperative pain or discomfort. There was no difference in the incidence of major postoperative outcomes.
In this pilot study, the use of OGT did not impact the immediate postoperative outcomes after coronary artery bypass surgery. However, it was significantly associated with higher use of opiates in these patients.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-8">摘要</h3>
<p>The relationship between the frailty index (FI) and all-cause mortality in patients with kidney stones remains unclear, and whether this relationship is mediated by the systemic Immune-Inflammation index (SII). This cohort study analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in the United States, spanning 2007 to 2018. Utilizing Kaplan-Meier survival curves, Cox regression analysis, restricted cubic splines (RCS), and mediation analysis, the research investigated the relationships between FI, SII, and all-cause mortality in individuals with kidney stones. During a median follow-up of 6.3 years (16695 person-years) ,356 total deaths were recorded. A cohort of 2,620 U.S. participants was enrolled from NHANES 2007-2018. Frail individuals demonstrated significantly higher all-cause mortality compared to non-frail counterparts (HR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.56-2.02, P &lt; 0 0.001). Among patients with kidney stones, the FI showed a positive correlation with the SII (β = 38.18, 95% CI: 10.38-65.99, P &lt; 0.01). The SII indirectly influenced the FI and all-cause mortality in these patients, accounting for 5.6% of the mediating effect. Among U.S. adults with kidney stones, the FI is linked to a higher risk of all-cause mortality, with SII potentially serving as a biological mechanism.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-9">摘要</h3>
<p>Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) are considered healthy fats with a single double bond in the constituent fatty acids and have antioxidant properties, cholesterol-lowering properties, and ability to reduce chronic inflammation. Evidence regarding the effect of MUFA intake on gastric cancer risk is inconclusive among diverse populations. Given the differences in dietary composition among different racial/ethnicities, we aimed to evaluate the association between MUFA intake and risk of gastric cancer in a hospital-based case-control study comprising 1182 incident cases of gastric cancer and 2965 controls in Vietnam.
MUFA intake was quantified using a semi-quantitative validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). We used an unconditional logistic regression model to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the risk of gastric cancer in relation to MUFA intake.
Overall, there was an inverse association between MUFA intake and gastric cancer risk (ORper-SD increment = 0.75, 95% CI 0.67-0.84; Ptrend &lt; 0.001). Compared with the lowest quintile, the ORs (95% CIs) of gastric cancer for quintiles 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the MUFA intake were 0.86 (0.68-1.03), 0.65 (0.51-0.81), 0.53 (0.41-0.67) and 0.43 (0.33-0.57), respectively. A similar pattern was observed in both sexes and in individuals aged &lt; 60 years and those aged 60 years or older.
In summary, MUFA intake was associated with a reduced risk of gastric cancer in the Vietnamese population, regardless of sex or age. Our findings have great implications for gastric cancer prevention and control programs in low-middle-income countries and similar limited-resource settings.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-10">摘要</h3>
<p>Despite growing interest in environmental and social determinants of health, few studies have explored how residential mobility influences respiratory health outcomes. We examined the relationship between levels of opportunity across education, health and environment, social and economic, and all domains in a child’s neighborhood and the likelihood of emergency department (ED) visits for asthma and showed how moving from one neighborhood to another would affect the odds of visiting the ED for asthma.
In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed asthma-related ED visits among children aged 2 to 17 years in 9 US states (Arizona, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin) during 2016-2019. We used a multivariable logistic regression model to examine the relationship between the Child Opportunity Index (COI) and ED visits for asthma. We used a piecewise linear logit model to estimate the neighborhood’s opportunity effect.
Children living in neighborhoods with very low COI had a high probability of visiting the ED for asthma (adjusted odd ratio = 1.14; P &lt; .001). In addition, moving from a low to a very low COI neighborhood significantly increased the probability of asthma-related ED visits among children aged 5 to 9 years (0.8 percentage points), Black children (0.4 percentage points), boys (0.7 percentage points), and those living in large metropolitan areas (0.6 percentage points).
Our findings suggest that improvement in neighborhood opportunity may translate to better asthma-related health outcomes among children. Future research should continue to investigate the effects of neighborhood opportunity on other childhood conditions.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-11">摘要</h3>
<p>As China undergoes a rapid demographic shift toward population aging, a critical challenge has emerged for healthy aging policy: how can intergenerational support from adult children be leveraged to maintain and improve the functional ability of older adults? Drawing on nationally representative data, this study investigates the association between such support and the intrinsic capacity of older adults, and explores the pathways through which it operates.
This study utilizes data from the 2015, 2018, and 2020 waves of the China health and retirement longitudinal study (CHARLS). A multidimensional index of intergenerational support from adult children is constructed, incorporating financial support, emotional closeness, and caregiving. Two-way fixed effects models are employed to estimate the impact of such support on the intrinsic capacity of older adults. Furthermore, a mediation analysis is conducted-using the bootstrap method-to examine potential pathways through social participation, activities of daily living (ADL), and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL).
The empirical findings indicate that all three forms of intergenerational support from adult children-financial, emotional, and caregiving-have significant positive effects on the intrinsic capacity of older adults, with caregiving showing the strongest impact. the effects vary across subgroups defined by urban-rural residence, educational attainment, and co-residence status, suggesting substantial heterogeneity. Mediation analysis reveals that social participation partially mediates the effect of financial support (accounting for 14.63% of the total effect), while ADL and IADL explain 60.28% and 53.90% of the effect of caregiving support, respectively.
intergenerational support from adult children significantly enhances the intrinsic capacity of older adults by promoting social engagement and maintaining functional ability. To advance healthy and active aging, policy efforts should adopt a function-oriented approach that strengthens both family-based support systems and community care infrastructure, while fostering cross-generational resource sharing and coordinated support.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-12">摘要</h3>
<p>French legislation requires large and medium-sized hospitals to publicly report their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Yet, many hospitals fail to comply with this regulation, while others report voluntarily. The organizational drivers behind this behavior remain underexplored. This study examines whether hospitals disclose their GHG emissions as part of a broader strategy to differentiate themselves-similar to how they report patient satisfaction scores to signal quality. We explore whether carbon reporting is used as a vertical differentiation strategy in the French healthcare system. We used a mixed-methods approach. First, we analyzed national administrative data to test whether reporting GHG emissions is associated with reporting patient satisfaction scores. Second, we conducted semi-structured interviews with hospital managers to understand the motivations behind emissions reporting. Quantitatively, we found no significant association between the two types of reporting. Hospitals do not appear to use GHG emissions disclosure and patient satisfaction scores as part of the same signaling strategy. Qualitative findings confirmed that GHG reporting is primarily driven by internal factors such as executive leadership, process improvement, and organizational values, rather than external differentiation or patient demand. Carbon reporting in French hospitals is not currently used as a differentiation strategy. Stronger regulatory enforcement is needed to ensure compliance. In addition, hospitals require support-through methodological guidance, training, and the development of dedicated sustainability roles-to integrate environmental performance into their management systems and contribute meaningfully to healthcare decarbonization.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-13">摘要</h3>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic devastated nursing homes, highlighting the urgent need for effective outbreak control measures. This study analyzed twice-weekly PCR surveillance data from 134 Veteran Affairs Community Living Centers (December 2021-June 2022) to identify early predictors of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. Among 16,353 residents (mean age 74, 96% male, 68% white), we identified 1,868 infections and evaluated neighborhood ward-level case counts and their association with subsequent infections over two-week periods. Epidemic unit-days with no initial cases had an 87.49% likelihood of remaining case-free, while those with ≥ 4 initial cases demonstrated a 38.5% probability of developing ≥ 4 additional cases. These findings indicate that early case clusters strongly predict larger outbreaks, underscoring the importance of rapid detection and intervention. Study limitations include demographic homogeneity and reliance on frequent PCR testing, potentially limiting generalizability. This research provides a valuable framework for refining outbreak definitions and improving infection control strategies for respiratory virus outbreaks in nursing homes.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-15">摘要</h3>
<p>Pilomatricoma, albeit benign, may have a potential impact on children’s appearance and health. Clinical practice has revealed variations in the clinical manifestations, anatomical locations, and sizes of pilomatricoma among different pediatric patients. However, few studies have comprehensively summarized the correlations between these features and treatment efficacy, which is crucial for enhancing clinicians’ understanding and diagnostic accuracy of the disease.
This study aimed to comprehensively analyze the clinical characteristics, ultrasonographic and pathological features, and treatment outcomes of pilomatricoma in Chinese pediatric patients at a single pediatric dermatology surgery center.
A retrospective study was conducted on the medical histories of 209 Chinese children who underwent surgical excision with subsequent pathological confirmation of pilomatricoma at Shanghai Children’s Medical Center between January 2023 and January 2024. We carried out a multidimensional analysis integrating clinical, ultrasonographic, and histopathological features.
Pilomatricoma exhibits distinct clinical, ultrasonographic, and pathological characteristics in children. Key findings included: (i) Female predominance in limb/trunk involvement (34.5% vs 17.3% in males, P ≤ .01); (ii) Head/neck localization decreasing with age; (iii) Characteristic ultrasonographic patterns (88.2% calcification detection rate); (iv) No recurrence following complete excision.
Our findings demonstrate distinct gender-based anatomical distribution patterns and excellent surgical outcomes for pediatric pilomatricoma. The integration of high-frequency ultrasonography with clinical evaluation significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy, potentially reducing unnecessary interventions in this population. These findings provide critical references for clinicians regarding disease characteristics and diagnostic optimization. Key messages What is already known: Pilomatricoma is a benign hair matrix-derived tumor with diverse clinical presentations, often leading to misdiagnosis. Previous studies have reported its association with Wnt/β-catenin pathway mutations and a predilection for the head/neck region in children, but comprehensive analyses of gender-specific anatomical distribution and diagnostic optimization are lacking. What this study adds: This large pediatric cohort reveals gender differences in anatomical involvement (female predominance in limb/trunk lesions) and demonstrates that high-frequency ultrasonography (88.2% calcification detection) significantly improves preoperative diagnostic accuracy (71.3% vs. historical rates of 16%-43%). How this study might affect research, practice, or policy: The findings advocate for integrating ultrasonography into clinical workflows to reduce misdiagnosis and unnecessary interventions. Gender-specific patterns may prompt research into hormonal influences on tumor pathogenesis. Surgical excision remains definitive, with no recurrence, reinforcing its role as first-line therapy.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-16">摘要</h3>
<p>Numerous observational studies suggest that modifiable risk factors contribute to the onset of atrial fibrillation (AF). This study aims to assess the causal relationship between 46 modifiable risk factors and AF.
Univariable, multivariate, and mediation Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were employed to examine the causal relationship between 46 modifiable risk factors and AF. Summary-level data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) meta-analysis and FinnGen consortium were utilized for both discovery and replication. The combined results were analyzed using a fixed-effect model to confirm the robustness of the findings.
Among 46 modifiable risk factors, both the discovery dataset and the combined results confirmed that alcohol consumption, smoke consumption, job involves heavy manual or physical work, sleep apnea syndrome, trunk fat mass, body fat percentage, whole body fat mass, waist circumference, body mass index, basal metabolic rate, poor health status, diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, glycosylated hemoglobin type A1C (HbA1C), lipoprotein A, serum uric acid, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, hypertension, hyperthyroidism, and negative emotions increased the risk of AF (P &lt; .05 and false discovery rate-adjusted P &lt; .05). Conversely, college or university degree, impedance of whole body, and heart rate were associated with a decreased risk of AF (P &lt; .05 and false discovery rate-adjusted P &lt; .05). Multivariate MR identified sleep apnea syndrome, basal metabolic rate, diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, HbA1C, lipoprotein A, serum uric acid, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and hypertension as risk factors for AF.
Our findings offer new and comprehensive evidence demonstrating the confirmed causal effects of various risk factors on AF among Europeans. Larger-scale GWAS will be necessary to further validate these causal associations in the future.Highlights Our study investigated the causal association between 46 modifiable risk factors and AF under a two-sample MR framework. This comprehensive MR study confirmed that alcohol consumption, smoke consumption, job involves heavy manual or physical work, sleep apnea syndrome, trunk fat mass, body fat percentage, whole body fat mass, waist circumference, body mass index, basal metabolic rate, poor health status, diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, HbA1C, lipoprotein A, serum uric acid, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, hypertension, hyperthyroidism, negative emotions, college or university degree, impedance of whole body, and heart rate contribute causally to the onset and development of AF. No significant association was found between lipid levels and AF. Key messages What is already known on this topic: Previous studies have identified several risk factors associated with AF, yet the precise causal relationships between these factors and the development of AF remain unclear, highlighting the need for further research. What this study adds: This study systematically evaluates the causal association of 46 modifiable risk factors with AF by combining data from two independent GWAS datasets. How this study might affect research, practice, or policy: The discovery of AF-related risk factors provides valuable knowledge for early identification and intervention strategies for AF patients.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-17">摘要</h3>
<p>Despite improvements in children’s nutritional status and a commitment to early childhood development (ECD) policy developments in Ethiopia, the risk of poor ECD outcomes remains alarming. This study aimed to identify enablers and barriers to the implementation of ECD assessment and provision of nutrition-focused interventions in community settings. A qualitative case study was employed in Hawassa city and Dore Bafano district of Sidama region from November 2023 to February 2024. Fifteen key informant interviews (KIIs) and five focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with purposively selected key informants from the healthcare system and mothers of children under two years old, respectively. Pre-tested interview and discussion guides were used for data collection and a narrative thematic analysis was applied at different levels of the socio-ecological model (SEM). The existing ECD policy and strategy landscape, healthcare system, communication and trust built between the health Extension workers (HEWs) and the community, existence of different mothers groups and the HEWs positive attitudes were identified as enablers; however, gaps in ECD practical knowledge and community awareness, low commitment of HEWs and political leaders at multiple levels, as well as absence of training, facilities and standardized indicators of ECD were identified as barriers for the implementation of ECD assessment and provision of nutrition-interventions in the community settings. ECD assessments and nutrition-focused interventions can be integrated into the existing health extension program, with HEWs playing key roles. This requires raising awareness of ECD policies across all healthcare levels and providing targeted training for HEWs on ECD assessment and its targeted interventions. Building the capacity of all persons associated with health posts, and incorporating ECD indicators into HEWs’ services and their supervision checklists will enhance the effectiveness and sustainability of ECD integration in the community, leading to improved child health and development outcomes. Additional research is required to develop a tailored, user-friendly and time-saving ECD assessment tool for use in the community by the HEWs to assess, classify and identify children at risk of developmental delay.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-18">摘要</h3>
<p>This study evaluated the quality of ultrasound images obtained during peripheral vascular catheter insertion using a transparent film designed to maintain puncture site sterility during ultrasound-guided puncture.
Images were collected from 10 healthy adult participants with and without film, focusing on the radial artery, forearm cephalic vein, and median cubital vein. In total, 300 ultrasound still images were assessed using a 10-point Likert scale.
Image quality was significantly lower at all sites with the film (mean total image quality: radial artery, 5.2 vs. 6.0: p = 0.019; forearm cephalic vein, 6.1 vs. 7.6: p &lt; 0.001; median cubital vein, 6.0 vs. 7.4: p &lt; 0.001). However, the clinical nurse’s evaluation of puncture feasibility showed no significant difference for the radial artery (80.0% vs 96.7%) and forearm cephalic vein (100.0% vs 100.0%).
Compromised image quality using the film does not negatively affect the puncturability of the radial artery and forearm veins. This finding underscores the potential for maintaining sterile conditions during procedures without compromising the ability to successfully perform puncture, thereby improving patient outcomes and procedural efficiency.</p>

<p>PurposeTo assess the association of sustained obesity with medical expenditures and risk of hospitalization over time.DesignRetrospective cohort study.SettingThis study used linked data from ambulatory electronic medical records and medical claims.SampleAdults aged 17-64 years with (1) continuous enrollment in an insurance plan and (2) weight measured each year over ≥5 calendar years during 2013-2020.MeasuresOutcome variables were annual medical expenditures and annual risk of hospitalization. Covariates included sustained obesity or sustained severe obesity (reference: sustained healthy weight), year, age, sex, race, and US Census region.AnalysisGeneralized estimating equations were used to assess how excess costs and risk of hospitalization increased with sustained obesity or severe obesity over 8 years.ResultsObesity-associated excess expenditures grew from $1105 or 20% in year 1 to $5229 or 49% in year 8. The relative risk of hospitalization grew from 13% in year 1 to 159% in year 8 among persons with sustained obesity (versus those with sustained healthy weight). Differences were higher for those with severe obesity, and higher among females (compared to males) and those aged 40-64 years (compared to those aged 17-39 years).ConclusionsThis study’s findings provide evidence of a compounding effect of sustained obesity on medical expenditures and hospitalization risk over time. These findings underscore the importance of efforts that promote and support healthy lifestyles, including community access to healthy foods and physical activity for all.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-20">摘要</h3>
<p>Pre-eclampsia complicates up to 8% of pregnancies and is associated with increased risk of ischemic cardiac and cerebral disease, which may be prevented through management of cardiovascular risk when early disease stages are detected. This meta-analysis aimed to determine the prevalence of clinical and subclinical atherosclerosis in women after pre-eclamptic vs non-pre-eclamptic pregnancy with advancing maternal age.
A systematic search of the literature was conducted in PubMed, Embase and Web of Science for studies reporting on the prevalence of atherosclerosis in women with a previous pre-eclamptic pregnancy and those with a previous uncomplicated pregnancy. Any systemic atherosclerosis documented using ultrasound or computed tomography was included. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to compute the odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI for the association between pre-eclampsia and the presence of atherosclerosis. Subgroup analysis was conducted according to average maternal age at evaluation.
A total of 11 articles were included (13 217 participants). The average maternal age at evaluation ranged from 32 to 60 years. Within this age range, the pooled OR for the presence of atherosclerotic plaque after pre-eclampsia was 1.57 (95% CI, 1.39-1.78). The pooled OR of developing atherosclerotic plaque after a pre-eclamptic vs non-pre-eclamptic pregnancy increased gradually with advancing maternal age. The OR was not significant in the 30-39-year-old group (0.64 (95% CI, 0.10-4.15)), but the odds of finding an atherosclerotic plaque were significantly increased after pre-eclamptic pregnancy in the 40-49-year-old group (OR, 1.59 (95% CI, 1.34-1.89)) and 50-60-year-old group (OR, 2.00 (95% CI, 1.30-3.08)). At any given age, the percentage plaque prevalence in formerly pre-eclamptic women was roughly equal to that seen 10 years later in women with a previous non-pre-eclamptic pregnancy.
Women with a previous pre-eclamptic pregnancy exhibit atherosclerosis more frequently and approximately 10 years earlier compared with women with a previous non-pre-eclamptic pregnancy. Targeted primary prevention is required to reduce morbidity and mortality from premature cardiovascular disease in women after pre-eclampsia. © 2025 The Author(s).

<h3 id="摘要-21">摘要</h3>
<p>Infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a leading but also modifiable cause of gastric cancer. However, evidence indicates that the goal of a primary prevention of gastric cancer is still far from being achieved. Main obstacles derive from inadequate screening and management of H. pylori infection but also from other external risk factors, responsible for about a quarter of future cases of gastric cancer. The need for population-based H. pylori screen-and-treat programs remains not fully addressed, mainly due to concerns about cost, to underpowered screening efficacy of policies only targeting symptomatic people, to the lack of screen-and-treat approach performed early. Further concerns derive from persisting gaps between guideline-recommended H. pylori management and real-world patterns, leading to inappropriate therapies and increased antimicrobial resistance. A critical role is also played by unhealthy lifestyle and by environmental factors other than H. pylori. In fact, critical external factors increasing the risk of gastric cancer originate from the contamination of environmental matrices and of the food chain with toxic chemicals of anthropogenic origin. An effective strategy for the primary prevention of gastric cancer should therefore consider a full implementation of population-based screen-and-treat programs, but also educational strategies oriented to correct unhealthy habits, and rules and policies oriented to decrease the involuntary exposure to toxic chemicals. In the absence of this comprehensive approach and urgent and efficient prevention policies, local health systems should be prepared to manage the high cost deriving from the growing burden of a preventable (but not prevented) disease, as is gastric cancer. Maximal efforts should also be oriented to ensure a correct application of the available guidelines for the management of H. pylori infection. This goal should lead to an accurate selection of the best treatment regimen, but also to antibiotic stewardship, and to constant monitoring of outcomes and epidemiologic data, to improve quality and equity of care. Internist as well urge to master such topics which involve present and future key public health issues.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-22">摘要</h3>
<p>Semiarid regions are unique, and in Northeast Brazil, estuarine basins are often impacted by human occupation, resulting in the input of chemicals. The objective of this study was to evaluate the contributions of urban and rural activities to the environmental quality of the Acaraú River, using molecular markers in superficial sediments. Concentrations of total sterols and hormones varied between 271.5-2525.0 ng g-1 (dry weight) and 139.8-1728 ng g-1 (dry weight), respectively. Fecal sterol coprostanol ranged from 6 to 124.1 ng g-1 (dry weight). Concentrations of synthetic hormones were detected at one order of magnitude higher than those of natural hormones, and the diagnostic ratios for sterols, hormones, and coprostanol suggest sewage discharge and fecal contamination in the Aracaú River Basin. Activities such as fish and shrimp farming, which involve the use of drugs for animal handling, may also be relevant sources in the region. Regarding the ecological risks of toxicity, 17α-ethinylestradiol, mestranol, and estrone are compounds of environmental concern in the Acarú River, requiring actions to reduce or eliminate their sources.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-23">摘要</h3>
<p>The environmental challenges posed by nutrient-rich aquaculture wastewater emphasize the need for sustainable bioremediation strategies that integrate carbon capture and utilization (CCU) with effective nutrient removal. The bioextractive potential of Agardhiella subulata (AS) was investigated under fish wastewater (FW) and ammonium-supplemented fish wastewater (AFW) conditions. Over 14 days, AS cultivated in AFW exhibited a 67% higher growth rate, reaching a carbon capture efficiency of 10.42 g C/ton of water/day (a 168% increase), and achieving an ammonium removal rate of 2.39 mg/L/day. Metabolomic analysis indicated that nitrogen enrichment activated nitrogen assimilation and protein biosynthesis pathways, enhancing AS’s capacity to thrive in high-nitrogen environments. These findings underscore AS’s dual functionality in nitrogen cycling and carbon sequestration, reinforcing its role as a sustainable solution for aquaculture wastewater management. AS’s potential for bioactive compound production also highlights its value in circular economy frameworks, positioning it as a promising candidate for next-generation aquaculture systems.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-24">摘要</h3>
<p>Using the methodological approach of systematic review several regulatory bodies and associations have performed an assessment of existing evidence on the adverse effects of fluoride. The most recent review by EFSA published in 2025 recommended a fluoride level in drinking water of below 1.5 mg/L and a maximum total daily intake of 3.3 mg of fluoride as safe level with particular respect to pregnant women and the exposed unborn child. Our work focusses on individual exposure aspects, evaluating the contribution of major sources, specifically those which can be influenced by personal behaviour. We demonstrate that black or green tea and fluoridated household salt-even at salt intake levels below the population 25th percentile-are main contributors of the daily fluoride exposure in the population. Using the safe level proposed by EFSA, we have calculated different exposure scenarios that may be used by individuals to estimate their specific exposure to fluoride from known sources. Considering that the safe level proposed by EFSA can be exceeded e.g. by drinking more than two cups (300 mL) of black or green tea daily and using even low amounts of fluoridated salt, our findings highlight the need for clear labelling of the fluoride content of products to allow informed consumer choices.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-25">摘要</h3>
<p>This study examines how neighborhood social cohesion and physical disorder, measured at baseline and as change over time, are associated with multiple chronic conditions (MCCs) among older adults and whether these associations vary by race/ethnicity. Using 6 years of data from the National Health and Aging Trends Study (2015-2021), mixed-effects Poisson regression models were applied to a sample of 3,389 community-dwelling older adults. Higher social cohesion at baseline and increases in cohesion over time were associated with greater MCC burden. No significant associations were found for physical disorder, either at baseline or in changes over time. A significant interaction indicated that non-Hispanic Black older adults had lower MCC scores than non-Hispanic White adults in neighborhoods with higher baseline levels of physical disorder. No significant interactions were observed for social cohesion. It highlights the importance of public health strategies that combine environmental improvements with culturally responsive approaches to address group-specific resilience.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-26">摘要</h3>
<p>Urban land-use change significantly alters soil microbial communities, with consequences for ecosystem functionality and public health. However, the ecological and health-related outcomes of converting cropland into urban green infrastructure remain poorly characterized. In this study, we examined how three land-use types, afforestation, constructed wetlands, and urban infrastructure, affect soil bacterial diversity, community assembly, and pathogen risk over a three-year period (2019-2023). Using full-length 16S rRNA sequencing, enzyme activity assays, network analysis, and a composite pathogen risk index, we found that green infrastructure markedly enhanced bacterial diversity and community stability. For example, constructed wetlands increased bacterial richness and phylogenetic diversity by over 5 % and 8 %, respectively, and promoted deterministic community assembly. They also exhibited the lowest pathogen risk index (0.312), representing a 50.94 % reduction compared to the initial cropland. In afforested soils, more than 80 % of the pathogenic taxa present in 2023 were inherited from the 2021 community, indicating stabilization over time. In contrast, maize-wheat rotation croplands retained over 85 % of earlier pathogenic taxa and had the highest risk index, likely due to continuous organic fertilization. Pathogen-bacterial interaction networks in croplands were more complex and fragmented, whereas green infrastructure supported simpler, more stable interactions. These findings highlight the role of green infrastructure in reducing soil-borne pathogen risks while supporting microbial diversity, offering actionable insights for sustainable land management and urban public health planning.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-27">摘要</h3>
<p>There is a substantial unmet need for contraception in West Africa. Providing contraception in private pharmacies, which often are highly accessible, may alleviate some access barriers. However, privacy is a key concern for provision of contraceptives in pharmacies, and whether users view pharmacies as private is ambiguous. While some pharmacy users note their privacy benefits, others suggest a lack of privacy. The ACEPT Project aims to introduce the administration of injectable and implant contraceptives into pharmacies across Côte d’Ivoire, Senegal, and Togo. Baseline data collected prior to implementation of the ACEPT project across the 3 countries included in-depth interviews with both pharmacies and users and ethnographic observations of pharmacies. Qualitative data were first analysed by country teams, and emergent cross-cutting themes were identified collaboratively. Physical, private space is scarce in pharmacy settings in West Africa. In this context, users employ tactics to uphold both audio (not being heard) and visual (not being seen) privacy. These tactics include using coded language or hiding a contraceptive purchase among other products. Pharmacists are experts at reading user privacy cues and “play along” with user tactics. Pharmacists also engineer “virtual” private space in the pharmacy through arrangement of shelving and products and identifying private corners of the pharmacy when needed. Privacy is currently constructed momentarily in ways that render the public pharmacy space private. As contraceptive services in pharmacies expand, especially to include injectable and implant administration, this type of privacy creation may need to be addressed, and physical private space will become essential.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-28">摘要</h3>
<p>Access to timely image interpretation is critical for accurate diagnosis and effective patient management. However, radiologist shortages are likely to compromise image interpretation turnaround times (TATs) and leave many radiographs unreported. This cross-sectional survey-based study examines image interpretation TATs and the volume of unreported radiographs in Ghanaian healthcare facilities.
A cross-sectional survey was conducted across public and private healthcare facilities in Ghana. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire collecting information on facility characteristics, access to radiologist, radiographic workload and reporting TATs. Data were analysed descriptively and inferentially using SPSS v24. A p-value of &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant for differences.
53.8 % (n = 63) of the facilities had no radiologist, 19.7 % (n = 23) had full-time radiologists, 10.3 % (n = 12) had part-time, and 16.2 % (n = 19) relied on remote reporting. For facilities with access to radiologists (n = 54), emergency cases were mostly reported within 24 h (48.1 %, n = 26/54), while non-emergency cases took 2-3 days (59.3 %, n = 32/54). Radiologist shortages (94.4 %, n = 51/54) and high radiologist workload (77.8 %, n = 41/54) were the most frequently cited causes of reporting delays. Across the 117 facilities, the majority (57.3 %, n = 67/117) indicated performing between 10,001 and 20,000 general radiographic examinations annually, with 54.7 % (n = 64/117) indicating that all radiographs produced were unreported.
Many healthcare facilities in Ghana are confronted with substantial delays in image reporting times and large volumes of unreported X-ray images.
Delays in X-ray reporting times and high volumes of unreported radiographs may negatively impact effective healthcare delivery. Addressing these through targeted interventions may help improve service delivery.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-29">摘要</h3>
<p>To better inform pneumococcal immunization policies, ongoing surveillance for pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is crucial. To estimate the serotype-specific CAP burden of pneumococcal disease following the introduction of a new 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), V114, a 15-plex serotype-specific urine antigen detection (SSUAD) assay was developed as a tool for surveillance of Streptococcuspneumoniae serotypes. V114-017 (NCT03547167; EudraCT 2017-004915-38) was a phase 3 randomized controlled trial in which participants (18-49 years) received V114 or 13-valent PCV (PCV13; as an active comparator), followed 6 months later by 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23). Here, we report findings from a prespecified sub-study nested within the phase 3 trial that descriptively assessed the impact of nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NP/OP) carriage and pneumococcal vaccination on serotype detection with the SSUAD assay. In total, 301 individuals (all American Indian/Alaska Native) participated in the sub-study. NP/OP and urine samples were collected at 10 timepoints between baseline (prior to vaccination) and Month 7 (30 days following vaccination with PPSV23). NP/OP carriage was determined using qualitative polymerase chain reaction for pneumococcus detection and serotyping, and urine samples were tested in parallel with SSUAD. At any timepoint, NP/OP carriage was &lt;2.0 % for 10 of the V114 serotypes; carriage was ∼2.6 % for serotype 1 and ranged between 4.0 % and 7.0 % for serotypes 4, 5, 9V, and 33F. At baseline, serotype-specific pneumococcal polysaccharide antigens were detected by SSUAD in only six study participants for serotypes 19A, 19F, and 1. SSUAD positivity for serotypes 4, 5, and 9V increased transiently following vaccination with V114/PCV13 and PPSV23, while SSUAD positivity lasted the longest for serotype 19A following PPSV23 vaccination. In general, SSUAD positivity appeared unrelated to NP/OP carriage. Our findings suggest SSUAD can support pneumococcal disease surveillance and vaccine effectiveness research, excluding individuals with recent pneumococcal vaccination to avoid false-positives.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-30">摘要</h3>
<p>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) poses a significant public health threat, particularly to children and the elderly. Two protein-based vaccines and one mRNA vaccine have been approved, all targeting the prefusion conformation of the fusion (F) trimer. However, it has been reported that the epitope activity of the F protein gradually declines during storage, resulting in a reduction of the vaccines’ immunogenicity.
In this study, we engineered a redesigned pre-F-based antigen, monomer A, derive from the RSV subtype A F protein, aiming to preserve immunodominant pre-F-specific epitopes while eliminating sub-potent ones. Following this design principle, we constructed a series of single-chain (sc) dimers and selected the one, scDimer AA, with the highest expression yield and melting temperature (Tm). Next, we designed scDimer AB, which incorporates monomers from both subtype A and subtype B to form a heterologous sc dimer. Structural and protein characterisation analyses were conducted to verify our design. All monomeric and scDimer antigens were used to immunise rodent models. Additionally, we prepared the antigens in mRNA form and immunised BALB/c mice. Finally, we combined both antigen forms, administering intramuscular mRNA priming followed by intranasal protein delivery in mice. In all immunisation strategies, viral challenges were performed in animals to evaluate the immunologic protective effects.
Through rational design, we developed a monomeric and two single-chain dimeric (scDimer) proteins with the expected characteristics, including complete II, V, and Ø epitopes and a partial III epitope. The scDimers elicited stronger binding and neutralising antibody responses in rodent models compared to the monomer, and they also boosted T cell responses when combined with appropriate adjuvants. After three doses of scDimer immunisation, challenge with RSV resulted in barely detectable RSV in the tissues of immunised and challenged animals. The copies of RNA encoding N-gene were significantly reduced in the immunised groups compared to the PBS-injected control groups. We also engineered mRNA versions of the antigens and demonstrated their protective efficacy in mice. Notably, there were no significant differences between intranasal boost and intramuscular boost after one dose of intramuscular after RSV challenged, suggesting that intranasal boost provided equivalent protection to intramuscular vaccination and could reduce the risk of vaccine-enhanced disease (VED) potentially.
The scDimer-based RSV vaccines effectively protected rodents from RSV infections, highlighting their clinical potential. Our antigen design removed certain suboptimal epitope regions, enhancing the efficiency of antigen presentation and increasing the proportion of the most potent pre-F-specific neutralising antibodies. This approach provides a distinct perspective for future vaccine design.

<h3 id="摘要-32">摘要</h3>
<p>Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) are a significant source of added sugars in the Indian diet, contributing to adverse health outcomes such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and dental caries. Multi-component interventions (MCIs) have shown promise in reducing the consumption of harmful products like tobacco. This study assessed the effectiveness of a multi-component intervention-comprising Pictorial Health Warnings (PHWs), educational pamphlets, and targeted counseling-in reducing parental purchases of SSBs for children.
A randomized stepped-wedge controlled trial was conducted across three urban slum sectors in Hyderabad. A total of 60 parents were recruited, with data collected over ten weeks. MCIs were implemented on SSBs at general stores, and outcomes were measured by comparing SSB purchase frequency, risk perception, and parental attitudes before and after the intervention.
The implementation of MCIs led to a significant reduction in SSB purchases, with 25% of parents buying SSBs post-intervention compared to 55% pre-intervention (p = 0.002). Parents also purchased SSBs with fewer calories post-intervention (45 kcal vs. 92 kcal, p &lt; 0.001). Additionally, MCIs increased awareness of SSB-related harms (d = 2.19, p &lt; 0.001) and strengthened negative emotional responses (d = 2.08, p &lt; 0.001). No significant differences were observed in the appeal or perceived tastiness of SSBs (p &gt; 0.05).
MCIs on SSBs effectively reduced purchase frequency and calorie intake among parents in urban slum settings. The findings support the potential for MCIs to be a feasible public health intervention to reduce SSB consumption in similar socio-economic contexts.

<h3 id="摘要-33">摘要</h3>
<p>To ensure the large number of school-based physical activity and nutrition programs have a lasting positive impact on the health and wellbeing of students, it is essential that such programs are sustained long-term. However, there is limited research assessing the duration of such programs and the determinants that are related to their sustainment. This study investigates the duration of, and determinants to the sustainment of physical activity and nutrition programs in Australian primary schools.
A cross-sectional study with 207 Principals (one from each school) from a nationally representative sample of randomly selected Australian primary schools. Principals completed a survey online or via telephone, which included items assessing the determinants of program sustainment categorised based on the domains of the Integrated Sustainability Framework (inner contextual factors; outer contextual factors; characteristics of the intervention; and processes). Schools were randomised to answer survey items relating to either physical activity or nutrition programs. We collected data on the number and type of programs, their duration, and factors influencing the sustainment of one selected program. Descriptive statistics were used to assess the duration and prevalence of programs. Regression analysis was used to assess the association between sustainment determinants and the duration of program delivery.
Schools randomised to physical activity programs implemented on average, 5.4 of the nine physical activity programs assessed. Schools randomised to nutrition implemented on average, 2.8 of the seven nutrition programs assessed. Physical activity programs had a mean duration of 6.9 years and nutrition programs had 7.4 years. Nutrition programs had 3.27 times the odds of being sustained longer than physical activity programs (95% CI: 1.57, 6.83; p = 0.002). The only domain from the Integrated Sustainability Framework that was statistically significantly associated with the sustainment for both physical activity and nutrition programs was outer contextual factors. This domain includes the alignment of the program with the priorities of the school, partnerships between the school and external organisations, and the existence of a governing body policy or guideline related to the program. The highest ranked determinant from this domain for both physical activity and nutrition programs was the alignment of the program with the priorities of the school.
This study highlights the need for targeted strategies to support the sustainment of health programs in schools, particularly focusing on outer contextual factors. Specifically, the alignment of the program with the priorities of the school. Policymakers and practitioners should prioritise targeting these outer contextual determinants to enhance the sustainment of physical activity and nutrition programs, ultimately promoting better long-term population health outcomes.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-34">摘要</h3>
<p>HIV stigma is a huge impediment to ending the HIV epidemic. To develop effective HIV interventions, we must determine factors associated with HIV stigma, particularly among high-risk groups like people who inject drugs (PWID). We aimed to identify predictors of perceived HIV stigma (PHS) among a sample of PWID from 23 U.S. cities.
We analyzed the 2018 National HIV Behavioral Surveillance data on PWID aged ≥ 18 years. PHS was assessed using a validated survey that measured four PHS constructs: perceived unfriendliness, perceived discrimination, perceived punishment, and perceived support. We created a composite PHS index score by summing each participant’s four measures of PHS and categorizing participants based on whether their score was above or below the mean PHS index score. Adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) and 95% CI were calculated using the generalized linear model Poisson regression log-link function to assess the predictors of PHS.
A total of 10,925 (10,229 HIV-negative, 179 HIV-positive-unaware, and 517 HIV-positive-aware) PWID were assessed. PHS prevalence was similar (52.6%, 53.4%, 53.6%) across groups, but the predictors differed by HIV status. For HIV-negative group, PHS predictors were older age (≥ 50 years: aPR 1:10, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-1.19), female sex (aPR 1.07, 95% CI: 1.03-1.10), Hispanic (aPR 1.11, 95% CI: 1.06-1.16) and Other (aPR 1.08, 95% CI: 1.02-1.14) race/ethnicity, homelessness (aPR 1.07, 95% CI: 1.03-1.10), receptive syringe sharing (aPR 1.09, 95% CI: 1.05-1.13), participation in drug use treatment (aPR 0.96, 95% CI: 0.93-0.99), syringe service program (SSP) (aPR 0.94, 95% CI: 0.91-0.97), and no HIV testing (aPR 1.07, 95% CI: 1.03-1.10) within 12 month before the interview. For HIV-positive-unaware PWID, past-year homelessness (aPR 2.23, 95% CI: 1.46-1.3.40) and incarceration (aPR 0.71, 95% CI: 0.57-0.89) were linked with PHS. Among HIV-positive-aware PWID, PHS predictors included younger age (30-39 years: (aPR 1.28, 95% CI: 1.01-1.62), female sex (aPR 1.28, 95% CI: 1.05-1.55), Hispanic race/ethnicity (aPR 1.52, 95% CI: 1.23-1.89), incarceration (aPR 1.32, 95% CI: 1.10-1.56), and past-year SSP participation (aPR 0.84, 95% CI: 0.74-0.96).
PHS predictors differed by HIV status. The current findings highlight the importance of leveraging SSP and drug use treatment to combat HIV stigma effectively.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-35">摘要</h3>
<p>Pott’s puffy tumour (PPT), characterized by subperiosteal abscess formation secondary to frontal bone osteomyelitis, is a rare clinical entity. This case series highlights tuberculosis as an unexpected cause of PPT. Two cases of PPT, diagnosed histologically and surgically managed within a one-year period, were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical, radiological, operative, and histopathological findings were evaluated. Both cases, aged 12 and 26 years respectively, presented with forehead swelling, headache, and low-grade fever. Imaging revealed subperiosteal abscesses involving the frontal bone. Surgical exploration and drainage confirmed PPT, with unexpected histopathological findings of tuberculosis. Anti-tubercular therapy led to symptom resolution and lesion regression. These cases underscore the need to consider tuberculosis as a differential diagnosis in PPT. Timely diagnosis and appropriate anti-tubercular therapy are critical for successful management and prevention of complications. Awareness of tuberculosis as a possible aetiological factor is particularly important in regions with a high disease burden.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-36">摘要</h3>
<p>Steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), such as spironolactone and eplerenone, have demonstrated substantial benefits in randomized controlled trials for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. However, their effectiveness in heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction remains uncertain, and the implementation of this class has remained low, in part due to its side effects and tolerability profile. Emerging therapies that target the mineralocorticoid receptor and/or the production of aldosterone may offer alternative strategies to treat the aldosterone-mineralocorticoid receptor axis. For instance, the nonsteroidal MRA finerenone has shown efficacy in reducing cardiovascular and renal events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, as well as decreasing the combined endpoint of cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalizations in heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction populations. Large-scale, direct comparative outcome studies are currently lacking that compare steroidal MRAs vs emerging therapies. This review critically assesses the structural and mechanistic distinctions between nonsteroidal and nonsteroidal MRAs as well as mineralocorticoid receptor modulators and aldosterone synthase inhibitors; summarizes available evidence across heart failure, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease populations; and highlights ongoing and forthcoming research aimed at addressing key unanswered questions in this rapidly evolving therapeutic field.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-38">摘要</h3>
<p>Evidence links psychosocial work factors to work-related mental health problems, which affect productivity and highlight the need for workplace interventions. In order to establish sustainable change, a participatory strategy that considers the behavioral, organizational, and contextual (BOC) determinants when selecting and implementing interventions is needed. The objective of the current study, Vital@Work, is to prevent and reduce work-related mental health problems by using an evidence based Participatory Approach (PA) as strategy to compose a set of intervention activities tailored to BOC determinants. While the PA has proven effective in other contexts, in this study we examine the impact of contextual factors on the effectiveness of intervention activities delivered through the PA strategy.
The PA is evaluated as a strategy to implement intervention activities to prevent and reduce unfavorable psychosocial work factors in a multicenter cluster randomized controlled trial, including an intervention and control group in four different organizations. These four organizations are characterized by unique BOC determinants and differ in sector, size (small and large organizations), type of organization (private or public) and type of work. Employees in the intervention group receive the PA alongside usual practice, while the control group receives only the usual preventive measures. Effectiveness will be assessed through questionnaires administered at baseline, and 6 (T1) and 12 months (T2) after baseline. According to a power analysis, we strive to include a total sample of 1,040 persons at baseline. As primary outcome, stress will be measured using DASS-21. In addition, various secondary outcomes (sense of community, presenteeism and absenteeism) will be assessed. Longitudinal mixed model analyses, including subgroup analyses, will be conducted, along with a process evaluation to assess implementation.
The current study will evaluate the PA as a strategy to develop and implement a set of mental health intervention activities tailored to the organizational context, in order to prevent and reduce work-related mental health problems. By doing this, we aim to identify common and sector-specific challenges, contributing to knowledge on tailoring workplace interventions.

<h3 id="摘要-39">摘要</h3>
<p>Caring for an older dependent adult with cognitive impairment can have negative consequences for the family caregiver. Interdisciplinary interventions are necessary to address their needs jointly and comprehensively. While attempts have been made to improve their situation from different disciplines in isolation, a collaborative approach is required to ensure the best possible outcome.
A parallel, randomized, controlled clinical trial with two arms will be conducted at the Teaching and Clinical Unit of Occupational Therapy (UDATO) and the Municipal Unit for Psychosocial Support for Older Adults (UMAPS), both of which belong to the University of Salamanca and are in agreement with the City Council of Salamanca, Spain. The trial will also be conducted at the University Assistance Complex of Salamanca (CAUSA). Family caregivers, aged 60 years or older, of dependent older adults with cognitive impairment will be recruited. Participants will be randomly assigned to an intervention group (IG) or a control group (CG). The IG will participate in an interdisciplinary psychoeducational programme co-led by psychology and occupational therapy professionals. The programme consists of 12 weekly sessions (90 min each) over 3 months, covering topics such as emotional regulation, caregiver burden, cognitive-behavioural strategies, problem-solving, functional stimulation, and promotion of autonomy. Three monthly reinforcement sessions will follow. The CG will receive routine follow-up and resource information. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and post-intervention using validated instruments: the Caregiver Burden Interview (CBI), the CES-D Depression Scale, the Psychosocial Support Questionnaire (PSQ), the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), the WHOQOL-AGE and the Bayer-ADL Scale.
This study aims to enhance conventional clinical practice for family caregivers of dependent older adults. This will be achieved through an interdisciplinary psychoeducational intervention that aims to reduce overload and depressive symptomatology, increase social support, improve health and perceived quality of life, and enhance understanding of the syndrome. The intervention will also focus on managing difficult situations associated with day-to-day caregiving, managing emotions and associated erroneous beliefs, and promoting self-care. Additionally, the study aims to improve the functionality of the cared-for person.

<h3 id="摘要-40">摘要</h3>
<p>The population-based study was aimed to probe the impact of environments on migratory population. A preliminary research on the duration of Hainan and the changes of blood pressure between Hainan and hometown was carried out among 262 migratory population. Fourteen pairs of long-term migrants and short-term migrants who migrated from Northeast China were further matched. The environmental exposure was estimated with satellite-based indices, including NDVI1km,NDVI500m, EVI1km, EVI500m, PM2.5,PM10, temperature and humidity. The plasma samples were collected for untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics. The nonlinear relation represented that the differential value of blood pressure changes without taking antihypertensive drugs gradient descended and then rose accompanying with Hainan duration, and decline turning point of systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure were 4.43 and 6.28 month, respectively (P for nonlinear &lt; 0.05). Five untargeted metabolites and ten lipids were identified as differential metabolites between long-term migrants and short-term migrants, and one enriched KEGG pathway, glycerolphospholipid, was identified. The plasma PC (36:5) and LysoPE (18:1) levels were significantly positively correlated with the green space exposure (P &lt; 0.05) in the short-term migrants, and a negative correlation was observed between the plasma 4-carboxypyrazole level and temperature in the long-term migrants (P = 0.017). Our findings illustrated that moving to Hainan for about 4-6 months was more conducive to the improvement of blood pressure before taking antihypertensive drugs on hypertensive elderly, and the difference of plasma metabolomics between short-term and long-term migrants might be related to previous environmental exposure.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-41">摘要</h3>
<p>A longitudinal study was conducted over 5 months on 22 primary school teachers without existing vocal disorders to assess the effectiveness of a 1-day preventive voice intervention in limiting vocal deterioration over the school year, improving vocal endurance throughout a workday, and promoting the adoption and maintenance of healthy vocal habits. A combined analysis of the variation of objective acoustic parameters [f0, Jitter, Shimmer, and harmonic to noise ratio (HNR)] throughout a workday showed that the intervention group (TEST) maintained a typical endurance profile across the school year, while the control group (CTRL) exhibited increased atypical vocal responses. Subjective assessments further supported the preventive impact, with the TEST group reporting reduced vocal discomfort and communication difficulties immediately after the intervention. Self-reported behavior frequency indicated significant progress and long-term retention of key recommendations, including “hydration,” “proper anchoring before projecting voice,” “giving short instructions,” and distance communication strategies. Some of these recommendations also negatively correlated with vocal complaints and workday acoustic variations, suggesting their preventive relevance. These findings support the effectiveness of this 1-day voice prevention program in limiting vocal deterioration and fostering sustainable behavioral changes. This study provides new insights into selecting the most impactful strategies to further improve the applicability and effectiveness of future preventive programs.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-42">摘要</h3>
<p>Although recent evidence suggests that glycemic variability (GV) has a negative impact on neurodegeneration, its role in Parkinson’s disease (PD) remains unclear.
To explore the association between long-term GV and longitudinal motor and nonmotor progression in patients with PD and to uncover the disease-specific and nonspecific mechanisms underlying this association.
We used data obtained from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative cohort. Three hundred seventy-seven patients with early untreated PD underwent annual motor and nonmotor assessments covering neuropsychiatric, sleep-related, and autonomic symptoms for up to 8 years of follow-up. Dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging results and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) marker levels, including α-synuclein, β-amyloid 1-42, total tau, phosphorylated tau181, and neurofilament light chain (NfL) were collected at baseline and for up to 6 years of follow-up. We defined GV as the intra-individual visit-to-visit variability in annual fasting blood glucose levels.
With respect to motor symptoms, a greater GV was associated with a greater increase in postural instability/gait difficulty scores (P = .001) and a greater risk of developing freezing of gait (P = .002). With respect to nonmotor symptoms, higher GV was associated with a steeper decrease in Montreal Cognitive Assessment (P &lt; .001) and semantic fluency test (P = .002) scores and a greater increase in Geriatric Depression Scale scores (P = .001). With respect to DAT imaging and CSF biomarkers, increased GV was associated with a greater increase in CSF NfL levels (P = .001) but not with other biomarker changes.
Our findings suggest that increased GV is related to unfavourable motor and nonmotor outcomes in patients with PD. However, we did not identify the specific mechanisms underlying these GV-related effects, despite its association with more severe neurodegeneration.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-43">摘要</h3>
<p>Mental health problems often start at an early age and can persist into adulthood, leading to physical and mental health problems such as substance abuse, sleep problems, depressive disorders, and suicidal tendencies. Therefore, it is important to invest in the mental health of young people through, for example, initiatives focused on mental health promotion and prevention. The ePartners robot buddy offers children training modules focused on enhancing resilience and mental health, specifically targeting self-image and social skills and/or addressing unhelpful feelings and thinking patterns in children’s daily life situations.
The study primarily aims to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of the intervention according to the children and their teachers and secondarily aims to evaluate its potential effects on the mental well-being (general mental well-being, quality of life [QoL], and self-efficacy) of children.
A single-arm, 6-week, pre-post pilot intervention study involving children and their teachers was conducted in 3 primary schools in the Netherlands. Outcomes were assessed using questionnaires. Primary outcomes were assessed postintervention and included feasibility and acceptability for teachers and acceptability and usability for children. Secondary outcomes included self-reported general mental well-being and self-efficacy and teacher-reported general mental well-being and were assessed at baseline and postintervention.
Data showed that the intervention was generally perceived as moderately feasible according to the Feasibility of Intervention Measure (mean 17.3, SD 2.6; on a scale from 4 to 20) and showed relatively high acceptability (mean 16.9, SD 3.8; on a scale from 4 to 20) according to teachers (n=7). Additional feasibility questions showed that teachers found it generally feasible to guide children who had few questions about using the robot. Feasibility was moderate due to limited time for integration, many content-related questions from children, and the substantial learning needed to select themes. Children (n=73) reported high perceived usability of the intervention (mean 15.2, SD 2.4; on a scale from 4 to 20). The perceived acceptability of the intervention by children was also relatively high, with a mean of 12.0 (SD 2.3) on a scale from 3 to 15. Teacher-reported QoL of children improved significantly from baseline (mean 36.0, SD 4.6) to postintervention (mean 37.2, SD 3.8; t64=2.77; P=.01); however, the children’s self-reported QoL did not significantly change over time. No significant changes in general mental well-being and self-efficacy scores were found.
This study provides valuable insights into the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of a robot-delivered mental health-promoting intervention within a primary school setting. Further research is needed to fully understand its potential benefits and address existing limitations associated with the implementation of such interventions in the school setting.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-44">摘要</h3>
<p>Copper exhibited serious toxicity while its accumulation was beyond the physiological threshold. Copper pyrithione (CPT) consists of two PT molecules and copper, is a new generation booster anti-fouling biocides agent widespread globally. The potential harmful impacts of CPT whether via copper accumulation have raised concern among people. Research has identified copper exposure caused deleterious effects on reproduction systems. Nevertheless, environmental-related concentrations of CPT exposure effects on female reproduction, especially the oocyte maturation and quality are still unclear. Herein, in this study, we documented the adverse effects of environmental-related concentration CPT exposure on oocyte maturation. The results displayed that CPT exposure significantly increased copper concentrations in oocytes and compromised oocyte maturation via disturbing organelles function, further elevating the level of ROS and triggering apoptosis. Detection of cytoskeletal dynamics revealed that CPT exposure decreased the acetylation level of α-tubulin and destroyed actin filaments construction, further induced the aberrant spindle apparatus and ultimately caused the oocyte maturation failure. Furthermore, CPT exposure altered the status of epigenetic modification in oocytes. Moreover, AmmoinumTetramolybdate (TTM) supplementation efficiently ameliorated the quality and maturation of CPT-treated oocytes through chelating intracellular copper. In summary, environmental-related concentration CPT exposure damaged oocyte maturation and quality in vitro via copper accumulation.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-45">摘要</h3>
<p>To systematically review the implementation strategies, outcomes, and quality of interventions aimed at increasing the uptake of breast cancer-related genetic testing services among high-risk women.
A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Campbell Coordinating Group databases from January 2005 to October 2024. Studies were included if they evaluated interventions to increase genetic testing uptake or facilitate decision-making about genetic testing.
A total of 27 articles were identified, including 18 interventions aimed at supporting breast cancer genetic testing uptake. Half of the interventions evaluated face-to-face counseling, while the other half employed alternative counselling modalities such as standardized DVD counseling, tailored written materials, and remote video or telephone counseling. Participant satisfaction was consistently high (≥80%) among most interventions, but cost analyses suggested time savings with alternative delivery strategies. However, feasibility varied according to delivery mode. Remote video counseling faced some technical challenges, decision aids/patient education materials were partly less engaging, and alternative counseling modalities might provide more limited opportunities to discuss emotional and social concerns. None of the interventions progressed beyond early adoption.
Alternative approaches to genetic counseling, such as video- and telephone-based delivery and tailored written materials, show promise in terms of feasibility and acceptability. Future research should adopt more rigorous, framework-guided implementation methods with attention to long-term sustainability, while also promoting greater consistency in terminology to improve transparency and comparability.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-46">摘要</h3>
<p>Quantitation of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) in human serum is required for clinical trials investigating the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and drug interactions of these treatments. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is gaining interest as an alternative to ligand binding for therapeutic antibody quantitation in serum. We report the validation of a method using nonspecific purification and targeted LC-MS/MS to quantify PGT 121.414.LS (a bNAb in development for HIV-1 prevention and treatment) in human serum. High-resolution spectra of tryptic peptides derived from the variable region were obtained on an Orbitrap for surrogate peptide selection, followed by multiple reaction monitoring using triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. Surrogate peptides were evaluated for linearity and reproducibility across the therapeutic concentration range using immunopurification or ammonium sulfate precipitation. Using ammonium sulfate precipitation, linear calibration curves were validated over 10-500 μg/mL (LLOQ at 10 μg/mL) using stable isotope labeled peptide internal standards. Method accuracy and reproducibility were evaluated using quality control samples (QCs) at four concentrations in the linear range. The average concentrations of all QCs fell within ICH M10 acceptance criteria. Matrix effects were investigated at the low and high QC concentrations across six lots of human serum. Dilutional integrity, stability, and effects of hemolysis were also assessed. The method exhibits minimal carryover and negligible crosstalk. The assay provides accurate quantification of PGT 121.414.LS in serum over the range of concentrations anticipated in specimens from treated persons living with HIV (PLWH) after initial dosing and prior to subsequent dosing of PGT 121.414.LS.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-47">摘要</h3>
<p>Transmission of foodborne viruses such as human norovirus (HuNoV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV) via frozen berries has become a significant public health concern. In this study, we investigated the long-term persistence of murine norovirus-1 (MNV-1, a HuNoV surrogate) and HAV on five types of berries initially frozen at -20, -80 or -196 °C and stored at -20 °C for up to 24 months. MNV-1 titers decreased by up to 3.2 log after 24 months, particularly on strawberries initially frozen at -196 °C, whereas HAV was more stable, with the highest reduction of 1.7 log observed under the same conditions. Viral persistence was influenced by berry type, initial freezing temperature, and storage duration. The greatest reductions were consistently observed on strawberries, possibly due to increased dehydration and recrystallization over time. Freezing at -196 °C often caused freeze-cracking of the berries, which became more frequent as frozen storage progressed, accelerating long-term dehydration and structural damage. Additionally, subsequent ice crystal growth and recrystallization likely enhanced dehydration, further reducing viral infectivity. Despite gradual reductions in titer, sufficient viral inactivation was not achieved. This reaffirms that freezing alone is not an adequate viral inactivation strategy, serving primarily as a preservation method that stabilizes food while temporarily suppressing microbial activity, rather than an effective means of eliminating pathogenic viruses. Additional interventions such as physicochemical or non-thermal disinfection are essential to ensure adequate reduction of viral infectious titer in frozen berries.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-48">摘要</h3>
<p>In this study, we have established a highly conductive Bi2S3/f-MWCNT nanocomposite through a sonochemical approach using a probe sonicator (100 W, 25 kHz), which functions as an effective electrochemical probe for the detection of 4-(methylamino)phenol sulfate or METOL (MET) in environmental water samples. MET, a widely used chemical in hair dyes and the photographic industries, poses significant environmental concerns when released into water systems, contributing to water pollution and ecological disruption. Comprehensive characterization techniques confirmed the structural integrity and enhanced electrochemical properties of the Bi2S3/f-MWCNT nanocomposite. The as-prepared Bi2S3/f-MWCNT demonstrated exceptional sensing capabilities, with a phenomenal limit of detection of 6.52 nM within a linear range of 0.01 to 2100 μM, and exhibited a sensitivity of 10. 514 μA μM-1 cm-2. The practical applicability of the sensor was validated through its successful use in detecting MET in real-world environmental samples, such as river water, pond water, wastewater, and tap water. Additionally, the integration of the Bi2S3/f-MWCNT sensor with a smart potentiostat provides a powerful platform for on-site monitoring of water quality. This work offers a promising approach for the detection of industrial pollutants and provides a potential solution for advancing environmental sustainability.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-49">摘要</h3>
<p>In this project we evaluate the effectiveness of preferentially initiating highly effective treatment vs. an escalating treatment strategy at time of diagnosis in a real-world clinical setting. We compare treatment outcomes before and after the implementation of new guidelines in a Norwegian MS-clinic in 2017.
Patients diagnosed and starting a DMT between the 1st of October 2013 and the 31st of December 2017 (Escalating Treatment Strategy group (ETS)) or between the 1st of January 2018 and the 31st of December 2020 (High intensity Treatment Strategy (HiTS) group) were included in the study. Baseline was defined as date of treatment start. To compare the two strategy groups, we performed cox proportional hazard regression analyses to evaluate time to first new relapse, time to new MRI lesion(s), and time to medication switch.
71.6% of patients diagnosed under the escalation treatment strategy (ETS), while 27.5% received highly effective treatment. 77.5% of patients diagnosed under the HiTS strategy initiated highly effective treatment, while 17.8% still initiated low -medium effective treatment. Median follow-up duration was 8.0 years in the ETS group and 4.0 in the HiTS group. Patients in the HiTS-group experienced a 70 % lower risk of having a new relapse compared to those in the ETS-group, with a hazard ratio (HR) = 0.30 (95% CI: 0.17 -0.54). The risk of experiencing a new MRI lesion (T2 or GD1+) was reduced by 77 % in the HiTS-group, with an HR of 0.23 (95% CI: 0.12 - 0.44). Additionally, the risk of switching treatment was reduced by 67% for the patients receiving highly effective treatment at diagnosis, with an HR of 0.33 (95% CI: 0.25 -0.45).
The risk of clinical and MRI-revealed disease breakthrough, as well as the need to switch treatment was significantly lower in persons with MS who initiated highly effective treatment early, compared to those following an escalating treatment strategy.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-50">摘要</h3>
<p>Cadmium (Cd), a known food pollutant, has been demonstrated in numerous studies to induce neurological damage. The pathogenic mechanisms of cadmium chloride (CdCl2) and cadmium sulfate (CdSO4) are generally attributed to the induction of oxidative stress and apoptosis. Nevertheless, the extent to which these two cadmium compounds exhibit differential concentration-dependent neurotoxic effects, as well as the specific underlying mechanisms involved, remain to be elucidated. In this study, the differential neurotoxic effects and underlying mechanisms were explored in PC12 cells which were treated with 0, 0.5, 1 and 2 μmol/L of CdCl2 and CdSO4 for 24 h, and C57BL/6J mice which were exposed to 0, 50, 100, and 200 mg/L CdSO4 in drinking water for 18 weeks. Our present data indicate that both CdCl2 and CdSO4 elicit oxidative damage, genetic material damage, and apoptosis in PC12 cells, in which CdCl2 exhibits higher toxicity than CdSO4 at lower concentrations but lower toxicity at higher concentrations. Further mechanism analysis was conducted with the help of Non-labelled quantitative proteomics techniques and bioinformatics. The results indicated that the events related to oxidative stress as well as DNA damage and repair, such as Base excision repair, DNA replication, nucleotide excision repair, and chemical carcinogenesis-reactive oxygen species, are involved in the cadmium-induced neurotoxicity. Validation results basing on PC12 cells and mouse model indicated that the expressions of oxidative stress-related proteins Nrf2, Hmox1, Gsta3, and the DNA repair protein Nqo1 are upregulated, while the expressions of Pole, which involved in regulation DNA replication and repair, are downregulated. These results together revealed that oxidative damage occurs in PC12 cells under cadmium treatment, leading to genetic material damage and a decrease in DNA repair protein expression, which fails to repair damage promptly and induces cell death. Consequently, this study represents the first comprehensive comparison of the differential neurotoxic effects of CdCl2 and CdSO4 in neuronal cells across a range of concentrations. Furthermore, our findings also first reveal that cadmium may mediate its neurotoxic effects through the Nrf2/Hmox1/Gsta3/Nqo1/Pole signaling pathway. These results provide novel insights into the molecular underpinnings of cadmium-induced neurotoxicity.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-51">摘要</h3>
<p>Extreme temperatures and mental health are both public health concerns. Yet, evidence on the impact of extreme temperature on mental health is still scarce. Here, we studied the short-term association between daily temperatures and the risk of a primary care diagnoses, medication prescription and sick leaves for anxiety and depression. We conducted a time series analysis of adults living in the Barcelona metropolitan area from 2011 to 2022 using a primary care individual-level database in Catalonia, Spain. We defined outcomes related to anxiety and depression (diagnoses, medication prescriptions and sick leaves). We estimated daily mean temperature extracted from Meteocat for the area. We fitted a quasi-Poisson regression with distributed lag non-linear models for assessing the short-term association of temperature on the events of interest. Among 3,303,841 adults, 11.7 % and 4.2 % had a diagnosis of anxiety and depression, 32.3 % and 20.1 % had at least a prescription of anxiolytics or antidepressants, and 4.9 % and 0.9 % at least a sick leave for anxiety or depression, respectively. High daily mean temperatures (26 °C, 95th percentile), with respect to the temperature of minimum risk (1 °C), increased the risk of anxiety (43 %), anxiolytic prescriptions (20 %), sick leaves for anxiety (65 %), depression (26 %) and sick leaves for depression (43 %). The exposure and most of the outcomes showed an increasing trend. High temperatures may be associated with increased risk of anxiety and depression outcomes in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-52">摘要</h3>
<p>Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) has become a prominent global health issue within the realm of chronic liver diseases. Dietary interventions are of utmost importance in its management. This research, grounded in data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) spanning 1999-2018 and the National Death Index (NDI), was designed to clarify the association between dietary vitamin E intake and mortality among MASLD patients. Our hypothesis proposed that higher dietary vitamin E intake might be inversely associated with a lower risk of mortality in this population. A total of 7883 MASLD patients were enrolled. Their dietary vitamin E intake was accurately measured via the USDA’s standardized method, and numerous confounding factors were comprehensively taken into account. The findings indicated that a higher dietary vitamin E intake was significantly linked to a decreased risk of both all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in MASLD patients. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression models vividly depicted this inverse correlation. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses further verified the reliability of the results, showing that nonsedentary patients were more sensitive to the protective effects of vitamin E. Notably, the improvement of mortality was particularly significant in patients with increased total bilirubin and fibrotic liver. This study offers valuable perspectives on the potential role of dietary vitamin E in MASLD management. It suggests that increasing dietary vitamin E intake could be a promising preventive approach.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-53">摘要</h3>
<p>A growing body of evidence indicates a high incidence of osteoarthritis (OA) in both weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing joints in obese patients. The levels of leptin in the synovial fluid of obese patients with OA are elevated compared to healthy people, suggesting that leptin may be a key factor of OA in obese individuals. Synovitis can occur at all stages of OA development, causing diseases progression. We examined the effect of leptin on the inflammation in synoviocytes and demonstrated that leptin at its physiological concentration (1 ng/mL) promoted expressions of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 in SW982 cells by activating p65, p38, JNK, STAT1, and STAT3. Moreover, the lowest pathological concentration of leptin potentiated the effect of IL-1β (main cytokine involved in OA pathogenesis) via activation of p65 and STAT3, leading to a significant upregulation of the IL-6 and IL-8 production. Pretreatment with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids DHA and EPA suppressed the action of leptin and inhibited the IL-1β-mediated stimulation of synovitis by lowering the extent of p65 and STAT3 activation. According to our research, leptin may play a significant role in the development of OA in the joints of obese patients by promoting inflammation of synoviocytes through the activation of p65 and STAT3, while DHA and EPA, which inhibit activation of p65 and STAT3, can suppress the inflammation. Therefore, compounds that downregulate the activity of p65 and STAT3 may be the candidates for synovitis prevention and management in obese patients.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-54">摘要</h3>
<p>The goal of this study was examination of the association between the expression levels of the genes involved in high-density lipoprotein metabolism and atherogenesis and underlying metabolic pathways and the number of stenotic coronary arteries. Expression of 65 preselected genes in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the control patients (n = 63) and patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) with one or two (low stenosis group, n = 35) or three or four (high stenosis group, n = 41) stenotic vessels, confirmed by coronary angiography, was measured with real-time PCR. Functional enrichment analysis was applied for annotation of differentially expressed genes. Protein products of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the CAD patients compared to the controls were associated with metabolic pathways related to assembly, remodeling, and clearance of plasma lipoproteins, as well as with signaling and regulation of expression of the genes involved in cholesterol transport and efflux. However, comparison of the gene expression profiles and associated metabolic pathways between the groups with high versus low stenosis revealed specific differences between these groups. Expression of the CETP, PLTP, CD36, IL18, ITGB3, S100A8, S100A12, and VEGFA genes increased with the increase of the number of stenotic vessels, which suggests involvement of these genes in stenosis expansion via lipoprotein metabolism, inflammation, angiogenesis, and innate immunity. The set of genes ITGB3, VEGFA, and CETP was selected as a new gene expression signature of expansion of the coronary artery stenosis, which was validated with the GSE12288 dataset from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, demonstrating an average odds ratio (OR) of 7.49 (95% CI, 2.21 to 25.43). Averaged expression levels of the ITGB3, VEGFA, and CETP genes could be used for diagnosis, prognosis evaluation, and treatment of coronary stenosis with strong predictive power.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-55">摘要</h3>
<p>Aging biomarkers could potentially facilitate assessment of the rate of aging, age-related diseases, and allow monitoring of the effectiveness of preventive interventions such as diet, physical activity, and geroprotectors. This article examines key criteria for the aging biomarkers, including their association with age, prognostic value regarding mortality, ability to detect early stages of age-related pathologies, and minimal invasiveness. Comprehensive classification of the markers (clinical, functional, molecular, omics, digital) and evolution of “aging clocks” - from epigenetic models to causal systems based on Mendelian randomization - is presented. Special attention is given to the explainable artificial intelligence technologies that allow for interpretation of the algorithms, as well as practical use of the biomarkers in clinical studies in the manner understandable to humans. Prospects for the development of the comprehensive panels of biomarkers and personalized approaches to aging assessment are discussed.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-56">摘要</h3>
<p>Endocrine disorders represent a serious public health problem and frequently can be caused by genetic factors or their combination with environmental and lifestyle factors. Assessment of relevant genetic factors is important to estimate the risk of endocrine pathologies in an individual before their manifestation. Identification of genetic variations in proteins of the major histocompatibility complex is important with regard to the autoimmune nature of many endocrine pathologies, including type 1 diabetes. In this study, we investigated the relationship between human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes and 13 endocrine disorders by using experimental whole-exome sequencing profiles obtained for 895 patients from the National Medical Research Center for Endocrinology, Moscow. In addition, the linkage disequilibrium of the identified alleles in the context of the respective diagnoses was assessed. We identified totally 45 statistically significant associations between HLA alleles and specific diagnoses of endocrine pathologies. Among them, 33 were described for the first time and 12 have been previously reported for type 1 diabetes. Overall, 17 alleles were associated with type 1 diabetes and four alleles - with other forms of diabetes. Furthermore, three alleles were associated with obesity, five - with adrenogenital diseases, three - with hypoglycemia, and three - with precocious puberty. Single alleles were found to be associated with congenital hypothyroidism without goiter, hyperfunction of pituitary gland, adrenomedullary hyperfunction, and short stature due to endocrine disorder. The study shows that early HLA typing can help in detecting genetic risk factors of endocrine disorders. In addition, identification of disease associations with specific HLA alleles can broaden our understanding of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of relevant endocrine disorders.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-57">摘要</h3>
<p>Impairment in nutritional status (i.e. malnutrition) can significantly affect the progression and prognosis of patients with heart failure (HF). However, systematic evidence synthesizing its prevalence using new tools and associations with clinical outcomes remains insufficient. Therefore, this study aimed to systematically review the prevalence of malnutrition and its association with adverse clinical outcomes in patients with HF.
We conducted a systematic review of observational studies identified in four databases (Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science and Scopus), without date or language restrictions. Studies reporting data on malnutrition diagnosis from any integrative tool, and its association with predefined clinical outcomes in HF patients were included. Outcomes of interest were mortality, disease exacerbation, quality of life, physical function, and length of hospital stay. The screening process (Rayyan®) and the data extraction (Redcap®) were independently conducted by two reviewers. Disagreements were solved by a third reviewer. Risk of bias in primary studies was assessed by New-Castle Ottawa scale. Certainty of evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Publication bias was explored. A meta-analysis with a random-effects model was performed to combine data using R software. Heterogeneity was explored by subgroup analyses.
Ninety one studies were included [38.4% conducted in Japan, 79.1% involving inpatients, 59.3% of with Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) score]. Pooled data (n = 90 studies, 51,086 patients) estimated the prevalence of malnutrition at 44.6% (95% CI, 37.7-51.7%; I2 99.1%). This prevalence was higher in studies evaluating inpatients compared to outpatients (49.3 vs 27.1%) and in studies using the CONUT score rather than the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) (60.5 vs 15.7%). Malnutrition was associated with higher risk of mortality (n = 28 studies, 23,163 patients; RR = 2.02, 95% CI 1.53-2.67; I² = 88.3%), and prolonged hospitalization (n = 7 studies, 4803 patients; RR = 2.14, 95% CI 1.83-2.50; I² = 0.0%), without differences in the subgroup analyses. The heterogeneity and small number of studies precluded a meta-analysis of the other outcomes. 33.3% of studies had high risk of bias. For all outcomes, the certainty of evidence was very low.
Malnutrition is a prevalent concern among patients with HF, increasing the risk of worse outcomes. The high risk of bias in primary studies and the incomplete explained heterogeneity graded the certainty of evidence as very low. Taken together, caution is necessary in interpreting our findings.

<h3 id="摘要-58">摘要</h3>
<p>Community and system-based (eg, civil legal) advocates can play a critical role in the implementation of extreme risk protection orders (ERPO); however, the novelty of ERPO laws impedes understanding of their implementation in these settings. As most ERPO laws are based on Domestic Violence Protection Orders (DVPO), we explored how the implementation of DVPOs by system and community advocates can inform recommendations for advocate involvement in ERPO implementation. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 9 community and system-based advocates involved in DVPO implementation in the 1970s-1990s. We used narrative inquiry to identify strengths and concerns with DVPO implementation, then applied lessons learned to potential implications for ERPOs. Three lessons arose, with corresponding ERPO implications. First, advocates evaluated individual context before offering options, including protection orders. Participants suggested ERPO advocates should be prepared to offer wraparound services in addition to or instead of an ERPO, if contraindicated. Second, the “professionalization” of the role of advocates affected how they served clients. Participants recommended professional development opportunities for those with lived experience of firearm-related harm. Third, advocates were well-positioned to anticipate and identify inequities in DVPO implementation. Participants suggested an evaluation system be developed to monitor for any potential inequities in ERPO implementation. The insights from participants in this study, situated in historical context, offer ERPO researchers, implementers, and policymakers a unique opportunity to ensure that ERPO implementation aligns with its legislative intent of preventing firearm tragedies and proactively address and prevent potential unintended consequences of ERPOs.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-59">摘要</h3>
<p>Physical activity (PA) service provision in the post-secondary context is recognized as important for promoting student mental health. Nonetheless, most evidence is of poor quality and lacks critical information regarding how the PA programs are designed, delivered, and made accessible to students. This study will examine PA program effectiveness for student mental health and social well-being, as well as implementation processes to offer insight for future research and program scale-up.
Post-secondary students who are physically inactive and experiencing poor mental health will be recruited. A 3-arm parallel Randomized Controlled Trial, using a hybrid effectiveness-implementation design, will be conducted using a collaborative implementation approach. The effects of 6-week supervised one-on-one and group PA, compared to a waitlist control will be examined, with outcomes assessed at baseline (T1), 6-weeks (T2), and 1-month follow-up (T3). Primary outcomes will include immediate post-program changes (T1-T2) in mental health indices, including anxiety, depression, psychological distress, and well-being. Secondary outcomes will include changes from baseline to follow-up (T1-T3) and maintenance effects from post-intervention to follow-up (T2-T3) in mental health indices, as well as changes in social well-being indices (i.e., social connectedness, social support), and PA behavior. A process evaluation will be conducted to explore contextual influences (i.e., fidelity, adherence, reach, acceptability) on the conduct of implementation across PA program delivery styles. Effectiveness data will be analyzed using linear mixed effects modeling. Process evaluation outcomes will be analyzed using a mixed methods evaluation.
A knowledge mobilization plan to enhance dissemination of the findings to the intended audiences (i.e., sport and recreation professionals, mental health professionals, students, researchers) has been developed.

<h3 id="摘要-60">摘要</h3>
<p>Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) are one of the most prevalent enteric infections world-wide. To control STH-related morbidity, the World Health Organization recommends targeted deworming and improvements in water, sanitation and hygiene. Current surveillance strategies for STH focus on identifying and quantifying eggs in stool samples via microscopy, which exhibits poor specificity and sensitivity, especially in settings with low-intensity infections. Wastewater-based epidemiology is a surveillance tool used to monitor pathogen circulation and could replace stool-based approaches for STH detection. However, sampling strategies for settings lacking networked sanitation outside large urban settlements are not well developed. Here, we report evaluation of sampling strategies for soil and wastewater STH surveillance in rural and peri-urban settings without networked sanitation. We used multi-parallel qPCR assays to detect STH DNA in soil collected from high foot-traffic locations and three types of wastewater samples (passive Moore swabs, grab samples, and sediment from drainage ditches) in Comé, Benin and Timiri and Jawadhu Hills in Tamil Nadu, India. We detected STH in soil (India = 32/95, Benin = 39/121) and wastewater (India = 24/60, Benin = 8/64) with a detection frequency across all sample types of 36% in India and 25% in Benin. We evaluated which sample locations and types allowed for more sensitive detection of STH DNA and determined that STH prevalence varied by sample site but did not vary significantly within a given sample site location (e.g., samples collected from multiple locations within one market). Further, we determined that wastewater sediment samples outperformed grab and Moore swab sample types for STH detection. Finally, we expanded our methods to include detection of other enteric pathogens using multiplexed qPCR for wastewater samples. Our results establish sampling strategies for environmental and wastewater surveillance of a wide range of enteric pathogens in settings without networked sanitation.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-61">摘要</h3>
<p>A scoping review was conducted to explore what is known about gamification-based tele-rehabilitation (GBT) to enable physical therapy in home settings for people with Parkinson’s disease (PD).
The peer-reviewed literature (OVID Medline, OVID EMBASE, CINAHL EBSCO, and Scopus databases) was searched from January 2010 to May 2024, and 24 articles met the inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Downs and Black evaluation tool, and levels of evidence were assigned using a modified Sackett scale.
The majority of the 24 studies were of poor to fair methodological quality (83%), and all used a quantitative design with small sample sizes. The focus of the included studies was to enhance whole-body rehabilitation, with most addressing the upper extremities. Thirteen studies customized their games, whereas others utilized strictly commercial systems (n = 11). Eight studies reported no adverse events while the rest did not report on these. Eight studies indicated that participants maintained high levels of motivation and adherence in home settings.
GBT has the potential to offer a safe, engaging and effective physical therapy to the PD population in home settings, but further research is warranted to help delineate clearer implementation considerations.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-62">摘要</h3>
<p>Visual perception plays a crucial role in the daily participation of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in everyday activities. Exploring the relationship between visual perception skills and participation levels can provide valuable insights into effective intervention strategies to enhance engagement in various settings. This study aimed to evaluate visual perception and participation levels in children with ASD in terms of demographic variables and to examine the relationships between visual perception skills and participation in daily life activities. Sixty-one children with autism (mean age = 8.21 ± 1.05 years) enrolled in a special education center were assessed using the Motor-Free Visual Perception Test - 4 (MVPT-4) for visual perception and the Child and Adolescent Scale of Participation (CASP) for participation levels across home, school, neighborhood, and community settings. Statistical analyses included correlation and regression analyses to examine relationships between variables. Findings indicated that boys participated more in home and school activities, whereas girls were more engaged in community settings. Additionally, children from nuclear families had higher participation levels than those from separated families. Regression analysis indicated that visual perception was strongly associated with participation levels (β = 0.617, p &lt; 0.001), accounting for 55.8% of the variance in CASP Total scores. A significant positive correlation was found between visual perception and participation in home (r = 0.358, p &lt; 0.001), school (r = 0.313, p = 0.014), and community activities (r = 0.361, p = 0.004), suggesting that better visual perception is linked to higher participation levels. The results suggest that visual perception is a significant factor influencing participation levels in children with ASD. Furthermore, family type showed a significant contribution to participation variance in the regression analysis. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating visual perception-based interventions to enhance the participation of children with ASD in everyday activities, yet they should be interpreted as correlational rather than causal, highlighting the need for future longitudinal or interventional research.</p>
