<h2 id="article-1">1. A 20-year retrospective analysis of ocular and adnexal injuries resulting from animal attacks in Eastern China.</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: Annals of medicine

<h3 id="摘要">摘要</h3>
<p>This study aimed to assess the clinical characteristics, management strategies, and outcomes of ocular and adnexal injuries caused by animal attacks.
A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients hospitalized for animal-induced eye injuries at the Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University (2003-2023). This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University (Ref. No. 2024146, August 2024). Informed consent was waived. The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki. Clinical presentations, treatment approaches, and outcomes were systematically reviewed.
Sixteen patients with ocular injuries from animal attacks were included, with 75.0% being male (p &lt; 0.05) and a median age of 13.5 years (range: 2-69 years). Injuries were most commonly caused by birds (5 cases), followed by dogs (4), cats (2), fish (2), wasps (2), and bees (1). Most injuries occurred during attempts to approach or interact with the animals. Corneal injury was most frequent (12 cases, p &lt; 0.05), followed by eyelid and canalicular lacerations, cataracts, endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, globe rupture, penetrating ocular injuries, and orbital fractures. Treatments started on average 4.03 ± 4.98 days post-injury. Surgeries included eyelid/canalicular repair, globe reconstruction, lens extraction, and pars plana vitrectomy (PPV). Cataracts (p &lt; 0.05) and retinal detachment (p ≤ 0.01) were linked to poorer initial visual acuity (LogMAR). Post-treatment VA improved significantly, from 2.4 to 0.19 (p ≤ 0.01), especially in lens surgery patients (p &lt; 0.05).
Animal-induced ocular and adnexal injuries predominantly affect males and may cause irreversible visual impairment. Cataracts and retinal detachment predict poor initial vision. Early diagnosis and timely surgery, especially lens surgery, are essential for recovery. Public education and prevention are essential to reduce such injuries.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-2">摘要</h3>
<p>Tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells provide infectious, cancer and vaccine-trained immunity across barrier sites. TRM cells are implicated in autoimmunity, successful response to immune checkpoint blockade in the tumor microenvironment and toxicities that occur after immune checkpoint blockade in peripheral tissues. Here, we identified that signaling through the immune checkpoint programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) strongly impacts the early specification of CD8+ TRM cells in the skin. PD-1 is expressed broadly across mouse and human skin TRM cells, in the absence of persistent infection, and is retained on skin TRM cells in aged mice. PD-1 supports early TRM cell colonization, skin-specific programming and silencing of other differentiation programs and promotes TGFβ responsivity and skin engraftment. Thus, PD-1 signaling mediates skin TRM cell specification during immune initiation. These findings may inform therapeutic PD-1 agonist and antagonist use to modulate successful peripheral memory.</p>

<h2 id="article-4">4. Application of the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model to Understand COVID-19 Vaccine Decision-Making among U.S. Adolescents and their Parents.</h2>

<h3 id="摘要-3">摘要</h3>
<p>Although adolescents play an important role in their medical decisions, including vaccination, few studies have considered their perceptions or role in vaccine decision-making. We apply the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model to understand actor (adolescent) and partner (parent) influences of vaccine hesitancy on the decision to vaccinate adolescents. We conducted a nationally representative survey of adolescents aged 12-17 years old and their parents (n=721 dyads). Parents and adolescents completed separate online surveys measuring their vaccine hesitancy and intent to receive future doses of COVID-19 vaccine. We used structural equation modeling to estimate the association between vaccine hesitancy and adolescent vaccination among actors and partners using odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We identified a couple-oriented pattern in COVID-19 vaccine decision-making, with significant “actor effects” and “partner effects” on adolescent vaccination. Each unit increase in adolescent vaccine hesitancy was associated with 14% lower odds of adolescent vaccination (OR 0.86 [95%CI 0.82, 0.91]). For each unit increase in vaccine hesitancy among parents, the odds of adolescent vaccination decreased by 6% (OR 0.94 [95%CI 0.91, 0.98]). These findings suggest that vaccine promotion efforts should address vaccine hesitancy in adolescents in addition to their parents.</p>

<h2 id="article-5">5. Optimal intervention design for tonsillitis transmission via compartmental modeling with stability analysis and control strategies.</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: Scientific reports
<strong>发表日期</strong>: 2025-Jul-30

<h3 id="摘要-4">摘要</h3>
<p>Tonsillitis represents a significant public health concern, particularly for children and adolescents, leading to substantial socioeconomic costs. To address this, we developed a compartmental mathematical model to investigate the disease’s transmission dynamics and determine optimal intervention strategies. The model’s analysis establishes the conditions for disease persistence and eradication. Using optimal control theory, we assessed the effectiveness of preventative measures as well as treatments for both acute and chronic stages of the infection. Our findings demonstrate that a multi-faceted approach is superior to any single strategy. The most effective and robust reduction in disease prevalence is achieved by an integrated strategy that combines prevention with enhanced treatment protocols. This study offers a quantitative tool for public health officials, providing an evidence-based framework to design and implement more effective policies for controlling tonsillitis.</p>

<h2 id="article-6">6. Occupational horizontal pushing inducing massive haemothorax: an unusual case report.</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: Occupational medicine (Oxford, England)
<strong>发表日期</strong>: 2025-Jul-30
<strong>链接</strong>: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40730359">PubMed</a></p>

<h3 id="摘要-5">摘要</h3>
<p>We report an unusual case of a 55-year-old male machine operator who developed a massive unilateral haemothorax and ipsilateral rib fracture following occupational horizontal pushing of a cold-rolled steel coil. Notably, this occurred in the absence of direct chest trauma, coagulopathy or underlying anatomical abnormalities. The patient fully recovered after timely tube thoracostomy and hospital monitoring. This case highlights the potential for severe occupational injuries resulting from horizontal pushing activities, which are often overlooked and underreported in injury statistics. To our knowledge, this is the first documented case of haemothorax induced by horizontal pushing, warranting further research to guide preventive safety measures and enhance the recognition and reporting of similar cases, thereby improving clinician awareness of indirect occupational trauma. It underscores the need for standardized force limits and ergonomic interventions to mitigate such risks and eventually eliminate manual handling of heavy machine components.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-6">摘要</h3>
<p>Genetic findings are important independent prognostic factors in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). This study presents cytogenetic data correlated with clinical factors of 1337 patients aged 1-18 years with newly diagnosed ALL treated between 2011 and 2018 under the Polish ALL IC-BFM 2009 therapeutic protocol. Overall survival (OS) for children with B-cell ALL was 95.58% at 5 years, while OS for children with T-cell ALL was 80.43% (p &lt; 0.001). The event-free survival (EFS) rates were 86.69% and 72.92%, respectively, and the difference was also statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001). The most common karyotypes observed were normal in 31.79% (n = 425) and high hyperdiploidy (HeH) in 18.4% (n = 246). Two aberrations were associated with a good prognosis in patients with B-cell ALL: ETV6::RUNX1 (OS = 98.47% and EFS 92.75%) and high hyperdiploidy (OS = 97.52% and EFS = 92.5%). Patients with low hyperdiploidy as well as patients with BCR::ABL1 aberration (OS = 73.05%, EFS = 73.05%) indicated a trend towards worse results (OS = 92.29%, EFS = 81.21%). Death and relapse rates were significantly higher in HeH patients without trisomy 17 and 18 compared to those with double trisomy 17 and 18 (p = 0.013). Our study advocates, cytogenetic testing remains an important tool in the diagnosis of paediatric patients with ALL IC-BFM 2009 protocol, as well as it shows that cytogenetic testing’s use for treatment stratification improved the outcome of children with ALL in Polish paediatric onco-haematology centres.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-7">摘要</h3>
<p>The SF-6Dv2 health status valuation using the discrete choice experiment (DCE) method requires effective presentation strategies to improve respondents’ overall understanding and reduce bias, particularly in online surveys. This study aimed to determine the optimal presentation formats for DCE choice tasks through qualitative interviews.
We conducted cognitive interviews with 40 South Korean adults using the think-aloud and retrospective probing methods. Participants evaluated five presentation formats (non-emphasized, bold-underlined, yellow-highlighted, graphic circle, and color-shaded) and two duration attribute placement options (upfront vs. end).
Findings revealed that the presentation format influenced three key areas: readability, comprehension, and comparative judgment. The yellow-highlighted format was the most preferred (50%), followed by the bold-underlined (37.5%) and graphic circle formats (25%), with multiple responses allowed. However, the yellow-highlighted format was criticized for being a visual burden and overlooking non-highlighted information, while the graphic format had issues such as scale direction confusion and inappropriate level summation across attributes. Meanwhile, the bold-underlined format was described easy to read, helpful in grasping the meaning quickly, and visually balanced, thereby reducing visual overload. Moreover, it supported comparative judgment by allowing users to clearly distinguish and compare domains without cognitive fatigue. Regarding duration placement, 26 participants preferred upfront placement, stating that it provided essential context for evaluation. Interestingly, the participants preferring upfront placement prioritized survival duration, while those preferring end placement emphasized the quality of life.
While the yellow-highlighted, bold-underlined, and graphic formats improved comprehension, we recommend the bold-underlined format for future SF-6Dv2 valuation studies as it balances comprehension enhancement with greater stability in choice contexts. The findings also suggest that the presentation format has the potential to influence DCE response patterns, warranting further consideration in survey design.
This study explored the best ways to present health-related choice tasks in online surveys to help people understand health status and respond accurately. Researchers tested five presentation formats (non-emphasized, bold-underlined, yellow-highlighted, graphic circle, and color-shaded) with 40 South Korean adults. The study found that the presentation format can affect three key areas: readability, health status comprehension, and comparison between health status. Among all the formats, the bold-underlined, yellow-highlighted, and graphic formats were the most preferred. However, there were mixed opinions in the yellow-highlighted format and graphic format. For example, yellow-highlighted format was criticized for being visually overwhelming and making it hard to notice non-highlighted information. The graphic format caused confusion about scale direction and the risk of inappropriate summation of levels across attributes. In conclusion, the bold-underlined format was recommended as it balances comprehension enhancement with greater stability in choice contexts.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-8">摘要</h3>
<p>Several patients undergoing aromatase inhibitors (AIs) for breast cancer (BC) report cognitive difficulties, although studies on the cognitive effects have yielded mixed findings. This prospective study aimed to investigate the impact on cognitive function of adjuvant AIs and the changes over time.
Patients with diagnosis of early-stage BC, eligible for adjuvant AIs endocrine therapy, underwent comprehensive neuropsychological assessments for the evaluation of several cognitive domains before and after 12 months of therapy. Participants were stratified according to menopausal status, type of surgery, and prior chemotherapy.
Eighty-three subjects were enrolled and, among these, 77 patients underwent neuropsychological assessments. At baseline, post-menopausal subjects (71%) performed significantly worse than pre-menopausal subjects in tests assessing executive functions. Subjects who received chemotherapy were younger, but showed poorer episodic memory performance compared to those chemotherapy-naïve. After 12 months, although most patients (66.1%) reported cognitive difficulties, the neuropsychological performance did not show significant deterioration. Notably, differences in verbal episodic memory between subjects treated with or without chemotherapy persisted over time.
This study suggests that the cognitive difficulties reported by BC patients who underwent AIs may be more influenced by prior chemotherapy rather than from the direct cognitive effects of AIs, highlighting the persistent cognitive consequences of chemotherapy. These findings emphasize the need for further research to better understand the interplay between chemotherapy, AIs, and cognitive function and the relevance of cognitive assessments.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-9">摘要</h3>
<p>Hypovitaminosis D is prevalent during pregnancy and may affect fetal brain development, leading to neurocognitive issues. This study investigated the association between vitamin D levels during pregnancy and children’s neurocognitive functioning in 289 mother-child pairs, controlling for confounding variables.
Prenatal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations were measured in the first and third trimesters, and offspring underwent a neurocognitive assessment at age 4 using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-Fourth Edition (WPPSI-IV), subtests of the Developmental Neuropsychological Assessment-II (NEPSY-II), and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Preschool Version (BRIEF-P) completed by parents. Socio-demographic data, obstetric information, lifestyle habits, maternal emotional health, and parental intellectual performance were collected.
The adjusted regression models have shown that insufficient 25(OH)D levels throughout pregnancy were associated with poorer Visual-Motor Precision of the NEPSY-II. In the third trimester, inadequate 25(OH)D levels were associated with poorer executive functioning, as indicated by neuropsychological and behavioural assessments. Specifically, lower scores were observed in Working Memory on the WPPSI-IV, as well as in the metacognitive index and Inhibition on the BRIEF-P.
Maintaining adequate prenatal 25(OH)D levels may promote optimal neurocognitive functioning in early childhood.
Inadequate maternal 25(OH)D concentrations throughout pregnancy are associated with lower Visual-Motor Precision in children, and third-trimester deficiency is linked to poorer executive functioning. This study highlights the importance of maintaining adequate vitamin D levels throughout pregnancy. Findings support the implementation of public health strategies to ensure proper vitamin D intake and the monitoring of maternal serum 25(OH)D levels during pregnancy to promote adequate infant neurodevelopment.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-11">摘要</h3>
<p>Urban air pollution poses a major threat to public health and environmental sustainability. This study proposes a structured machine learning (ML)-based framework to examine how temporal and spatial resolution choices affect the accuracy of urban air pollution modeling. The research is conducted in two distinct phases. In the temporal phase, the impact of incorporating pollutant autocorrelation into ML models (Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Random Forest (RF)) is analyzed by comparing results with and without temporal lag features derived through autoregressive (AR) modeling. In the spatial phase, emission inventory data are aggregated at three spatial resolutions (500 m, 750 m, and 1000 m) to evaluate their effect on model performance in predicting PM and NOx concentrations. Results from the temporal modeling phase indicate that including lag features significantly improves PM predictions: RMSE for PM₁₀ is reduced by 25.9% (from 92.56 µg/m3 to 68.59 µg/m3), and for PM2.5 by 38.9% (from 61.10 µg/m3 to 37.30 µg/m3). Conversely, for NOx, RMSE increases by 53.2% (from 7.90 µg/m3 to 12.10 µg/m3), indicating pollutant-specific temporal behavior. In spatial modeling, a coarser resolution (1000 m) yields better performance for PM (RMSE = 13.51 kg/year), while a finer resolution (500 m) is more effective for NOx (RMSE = 307.50 kg/year). Among the evaluated algorithms, MLP consistently achieves the highest predictive accuracy across both temporal and spatial scenarios. These findings underscore the importance of selecting appropriate temporal and spatial resolutions tailored to each pollutant type. The proposed framework offers a flexible, resolution-aware modeling strategy that can support more effective urban air quality management policies.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-12">摘要</h3>
<p>Hypertension affects more than 4 billion people worldwide and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Improving physical activity is an effective way to manage hypertension, and there has been a lot of interest in the use of wearable devices for promoting physical activity, which have become increasingly popular in recent years, but in many countries, improvements in physical activity levels remain inadequate. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated whether interventions using wearable devices have a beneficial effect on blood pressure in adults. Following PRISMA 2020 guidelines and registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023442506), we searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and IchuShi-Web, identifying 21 randomized controlled trials including participants with hypertension, type 2 diabetes, or overweight/obesity. Interventions ranged from 12 to 48 weeks using pedometers, activity trackers, and smartwatches. Random-effects meta-analysis showed these interventions did not produce statistically significant improvements in systolic or diastolic blood pressure at any intervention duration (12, 24, or 48 weeks). Similarly, no statistically significant improvements were found in secondary outcomes (body weight, fasting blood glucose, and Hemoglobin A1c). Heterogeneity varied from low to high depending on outcome and intervention period. These findings indicate that evidence of direct intervention using wearable devices for promoting physical activity alone is currently insufficient to establish clinically meaningful improvements in blood pressure and related metabolic parameters. Future research may need to integrate wearable technology into comprehensive care models that combine targeted feedback and education with behavioral support strategies, rather than direct intervention through monitoring alone.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-14">摘要</h3>
<p>Neonatal seizures were associated with significant rates of mortality; in which about one-third of the neonates with seizure ending up with death. Despite this, the time to death and its predictors among neonates with seizure has not been investigated; especially in Ethiopia. To determine the time to death and its predictors among neonates with seizure in public hospitals of Awi zone, Northwest Ethiopia. A multicenter prospective follow-up study was conducted in public hospitals of Awi zone on 263 neonates with seizure. Descriptive statistics, Kaplan-Meier curve, Nelson-Aalen curves, and log-rank tests were employed to describe the time to death and to assess the risk of mortality among different covariates. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify the predictors of time to death. AHR with 95% CI was used to identify significant predictor variables, and a statistical significance was declared at p-value &lt; 0.05. A total of 263 neonates with seizure were followed for a total of 1334.3 person-days, and the incidence of mortality was found to be 22.5 per 1000 person-day observations (95% CI = 14.0-29.6). The median time to death was 3 days (IQR = 2-5 days). Birth trauma (AHR = 3.9, 95% CI = 1.5-10.6), neonatal sepsis (AHR = 3.4, 95% CI = 1.1-10.8), hypoglycemia (AHR = 3.2, 95% CI = 1.1-9.3), and tonic type seizure (AHR = 4.5, 95% CI = 1.3-15.6) were statistically significant predictors of early mortality in neonates with seizure. This study revealed that the incidence of in-hospital mortality among neonates with seizure to be high and the median time to death to be short; and the predictors of early mortality were identified. Early detection and appropriate management of neonates having birth trauma, sepsis, and hypoglycemia might be helpful.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-15">摘要</h3>
<p>This study investigated asbestos fiber concentrations and associated health risks in Shiraz over a period of one year and examined their relationship with various land use factors. Samples were analyzed using phase-contrast microscopy (PCM), and health effects were assessed using the EPA’s IRIS method. We examined the relationship between asbestos fiber concentrations and road network density, population, number of bus stations, and green space. The results showed that 10% of the sampling sites in Shiraz had low asbestos fiber concentrations, 20% had medium concentrations, 60% had high concentrations, and 10% had very high concentrations. The mean ELCR for asbestos inhalation was 1.44 × 10-4, indicating a cancer risk for 1.44 out of every 10,000 people. The highest ELCR values were found in the west, near the Shiraz Ring expressway, and in the southeast, near high-traffic areas. Additionally, no positive correlation was found between asbestos concentrations and population, bus stations, or green space, but there was a significant positive correlation with road network density. Motor vehicle traffic is the primary source of asbestos pollution, posing a significant health risk. Traffic control measures and replacing asbestos in brake pads with alternative materials are necessary to reduce pollution in Shiraz.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-16">摘要</h3>
<p>The T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, unique to each individual, forms a critical component of the adaptive immune system and serves as a defense mechanism against diverse pathogens. This repertoire encompasses a vast diversity of sequences, which can be profiled through high-throughput sequencing technologies. In this study, we present and provide a dataset of TCR sequencing data derived from 215 blood samples collected from newly diagnosed colorectal cancer (CRC) patients prior to any surgical or systemic treatment. Patients were classified according to the TNM staging system, enabling the inclusion of stage and risk labels specific to CRC. Dynamic changes in the TCR repertoire, such as the expansion or contraction of specific clonotypes, are known to reflect immune responses to disease and therapeutic interventions. This dataset provides a comprehensive snapshot of the pre-treatment TCR repertoire in CRC, offering valuable insights into immune system behavior in the context of cancer. The data can serve as a resource for further research into CRC immunology, biomarker discovery, and risk assessment studies.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-17">摘要</h3>
<p>Resilience is a multifaceted concept that spans biological, psychological and social domains, and is critical for population health-particularly brain health. While most existing research originates from the global north, there is an urgent need to explore resilience in the majority world settings, where unique biological, exposomal, economic and sociocultural factors shape health. In this Review, we highlight resilience as a key modifier of brain health outcomes. We explore the biological correlates of resilience and the influence of the exposome. We propose future synergistic integrations of exposome, cultural reserve, community resilience, allostasis and whole-body health principles to promote an inclusive perspective in diverse settings. This approach is particularly relevant for majority world contexts, where resource constraints and cultural diversity demand adaptive, scalable and context-sensitive strategies. We discuss measurement approaches and operationalization strategies and, finally, we identify key priorities for future research and policy strategies, with an emphasis on local relevance, equity and sustainability.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-18">摘要</h3>
<p>Several European countries have reported an increasing trend of human scabies in the past twenty years. In Belgium, scabies’ clusters hinted at a similar trend despite individual cases not being notifiable. We aimed to describe scabies’ trends between 2000 and 2023 in Belgium.
We described the evolution of scabies during 2000-2023 in Belgium using a variety of available data sources. Using generalized linear models, we analysed yearly trends and seasonality of scabies diagnoses at general practitioners (GPs) in Flanders, occupational health services in Belgium, nationwide asylum seekers’ shelters and consultations for people with precarious housing, and student medical facilities in Flanders. Additionally, we analysed national reimbursement and sales data for first-line scabies treatments in Belgium.
Scabies diagnoses significantly increased at all investigated levels (p-value &lt; 0.001): primary care (15% yearly increase, 2011-2023), occupational health services (16% yearly increase, 2011-2022, temporary decrease in 2020-2021), asylum seekers’ shelters (41% yearly increase, 2016-2022), consultations for people in precarious living situations (41% yearly increase, 2019-2022), and pharmaceutical sales (15% yearly increase in permethrin sales, 2012-2022). In primary care, those 15-24 years-old were most affected (13.2/1,000 compared to 4.1/1,000 for all ages in 2023), as were urban areas (6.7/1,000 compared to 2.7/1,000 in rural areas in 2022). Incidence was overall higher in males (p-value 0.016).
Our study shows a strong increasing trend of scabies in Belgium since 2011, with higher incidences in younger age groups, urban areas and during colder months. We recommend further studies to better quantify the increase and investigate the underlying drivers.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-19">摘要</h3>
<p>The high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV)-based screening recommended by the World Health Organization is expected to lead to worldwide reduction of the cervical cancer burden, but the countries burdened most by cervical cancer also struggle with the costs of transitioning to this approach. Country-specific evaluations are needed to inform policymakers on implementation of hrHPV-based screening for their setting. Following initial implementation in Uganda, Bangladesh and Slovakia focused on underscreened women in the PRESCRIP-TEC project, we investigated the potential cost-effectiveness and affordability of hrHPV-based screening strategies.
Country-specific model-based cost-effectiveness and budget impact analyses were conducted for the three countries, comparing the PRESCRIP-TEC strategy with the existing screening strategy in each setting. Data from initial project implementation informed the relevant model parameters.
The PRESCRIP-TEC strategy resulted in disability-adjusted life year (DALY) gains in all three countries. The cervical cancer incidence rate was reduced by a third for Uganda, 15% for Bangladesh and 11% for Slovakia. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were UGX 0.56 million per DALY for Uganda (I$ 475), BDT 76 thousand per DALY for Bangladesh (I$ 1698) and EUR 1782 (I$ 3637) per DALY for Slovakia. Substantial additional funding will be required to enable implementation, particularly in relation to the initial start-up costs.
The provided estimates can serve to inform policymakers and researchers in the context of implementing hrHPV-based screening in diverse settings.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-20">摘要</h3>
<p>Advancing organoid technology requires human tissue donations and collaboration between researchers and commercial parties. However, many potential donors have reservations about commercial involvement in organoid research. To better understand these reservations, we conducted four focus groups with potential donors. Two focus groups were held with individuals with cystic fibrosis (n = 10). One focus group included individuals with neurodegenerative diseases (Parkinson’s or Huntington’s disease) (n = 4) and the other consisted of individuals with neurological disease (epilepsy) (n = 5). Four themes were identified: (1) benefits and concerns regarding commercial involvement, (2) trust in involved parties in research, (3) control over commercial parties and (4) appreciation of donors. To address these themes, we recommend that researchers and commercial parties communicate transparently and effectively, actively engage and appreciate donors, implement robust oversight mechanisms and (re)establish trust and trustworthiness through responsible practices. These considerations can help researchers and commercial parties work toward responsible and sustainable organoid research.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-21">摘要</h3>
<p>Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome and sexually transmitted infections remain critical public health challenges in Sierra Leone, with major implications for morbidity and mortality. Understanding the trends in the prevalence of these infections and identifying sex-based disparities are essential for designing effective, evidence-based interventions. This study examined the trends in age-standardized prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome and sexually transmitted infections in Sierra Leone in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2019.
A cross-sectional study design was conducted using age-standardized prevalence rates (per 100,000 population) of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome and sexually transmitted infections from the World Health Organization health equity assessment toolkit database at five time points (2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2019). Inequality measures, including Difference (D), Ratio (R), Population Attributable Fraction (PAF), and Population Attributable Risk (PAR), were calculated to assess absolute and relative disparities between sexes. Confidence intervals (CI) were reported for all estimates to ensure robustness of results.
The age-standardized prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome and sexually transmitted infections in Sierra Leone showed a steady decline, from 25,995.3 per 100,000 population in 2000 to 25,705.5 in 2019. However, sex-disaggregated analysis revealed disparities, with females consistently experiencing higher prevalence rates than males across all years. In 2019, the prevalence for females was 34,548.5 per 100,000 population (95% CI: 30,887.3-38,496.7), compared to 16,734.0 per 100,000 population for males (95% CI: 14,674.0-19,020.4). The inequality ratio remained constant at 2.1, indicating that females consistently bore more than twice the burden compared to males. The absolute difference between sexes decreased slightly over time, from 17,962.9 per 100,000 population in 2000 to 17,814.5 per 100,000 population in 2019.
Despite the decline in the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome and sexually transmitted infections in Sierra Leone between 2000 to 2019, sex-based disparities remain substantial, with females consistently experiencing a higher burden than males. These findings underscore the need for sex-sensitive policies and interventions to address the causes of these disparities. Strengthening health systems, promoting gender equity, and implementing targeted prevention programs are essential to reducing the overall prevalence and achieving health equity in Sierra Leone.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-22">摘要</h3>
<p>Black cisgender women are disproportionately affected by HIV across the United States (US). Moreover, emerging adults continue to be significantly affected compared to women in older age groups. Yet in 2024, Black cisgender women and emerging adult women comprise a small fraction of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) users in the US. This study examined PrEP modality, service delivery, and marketing and communication preferences by age among Black cisgender women in Baltimore, Maryland.
Between October 2021 and April 2023, twelve Black cisgender PrEP-inexperienced emerging (18 to 29 years) and fourteen older (30 to 44 years) adult women were purposively recruited to participate in an in-depth interview. Interview topics included PrEP modality, service delivery, and marketing and communication preferences among the two currently approved modalities (oral and injectable) and the two modalities under investigation (ring and implant). Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using a combination of a deductive and inductive approaches. Six follow-up interviews were also conducted.
Emerging adult women preferred oral PrEP, but older adult women preferred long-acting injectable (LAI) forms of PrEP. Oral PrEP was preferred because it was considered the most common modality for other medications, whereas LAI was preferred because it didn’t necessitate daily administration. Emerging Black adult women reported their challenges with adhering to the routine PrEP three-month follow-up period, such as transportation, scheduling appointments, conflicts with school engagements, and being in a period of transition into adulthood where they experience structural changes (e.g., health insurance). Transportation was the only reported challenge for older adult women for follow-up. Both age groups preferred longer follow-up periods to refill their PrEP prescriptions and to obtain PrEP from a trusted physician (e.g., OBGYN). Both groups of Black women expressed a preference for PrEP to be advertised through diverse means including social media campaigns, sexual health forums, peer groups on college campuses, and by featuring Black women in PrEP commercials.
To improve PrEP equity and initiation of current and emerging PrEP modalities, it is crucial to integrate the lived experiences and preferences of Black cisgender women and enhance their representation in PrEP messaging.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-23">摘要</h3>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need to understand factors influencing individuals’ risk perceptions and health behaviors. This study aimed to explore the roles of individuals’ knowledge, perception, and health-related issues in determining COVID-19 risk by developing a predictive model for classifying individuals into the risk categories, incorporating both clustering and model interpretation techniques.
To identify distinct COVID-19 risk groups, clustering analysis was applied using the demographic, health, and behavioral data. Subsequently, several machine learning models-including CatBoost, XGBoost, Random Forest, Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Decision Tree, H2O Deep Neural Network (DNN), and L2 SVM-were used to predict risk classifications. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis was applied to interpret the contribution of individual features in model predictions.
Three distinct risk classes were identified: Class 0 (high knowledge, low-risk factors, no household COVID-19 diagnosis), Class 1 (health-related issues (e.g., hypertension), low lnowldge), and Class 2 (high knowledge, higher health risks (e.g., hypertension, household COVID-19 diagnosis)). L2 SVM achieved the highest accuracy (0.9724), followed by XGBoost (0.9301) and CatBoost (0.9265). SHAP analysis revealed that household hygiene practices and health-related issues, such as hypertension and Gastrointestinal symptoms were key drivers of risk classification.
Integrating individuals’ knowledge, perception, and health-related issues into COVID-19 risk assessments enhances predictive accuracy. Public health policies should focus on both physical and psychological factors to effectively mitigate the spread and impact of COVID-19. Data-driven models may inform future efforts to prioritize resource allocation and improve public health responses for vulnerable populations.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-24">摘要</h3>
<p>Incarceration is associated with adverse physical and mental health that are often brought to light during reentry into the community, particularly in the immediate period following release. Social support, specifically from family members, has been identified as a key protective factor that may promote health and reintegration success among formerly incarcerated individuals. However, less is known about how specific types of family support-emotional and instrumental-relate to health outcomes following release from incarceration. The current study uses data from 517 individuals incarcerated in a large Texas prison, surveyed before and approximately one month after release, to examine the relationship between family support and self-rated physical and mental health. Logistic regression models revealed that strong emotional family support was significantly associated with better self-rated physical health and mental health one month post-release. Additionally, strong instrumental family support predicted better mental health but not physical health among respondents. These findings highlight the crucial role of emotional and instrumental familial support systems in fostering and reducing health disparities and promoting equity among justice-impacted populations.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-25">摘要</h3>
<p>Adult trauma patients with refractory acute cardiopulmonary failure suffer from high morbidity and mortality. In the past decade, a growing body of researches has shown survival benefits of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in trauma patients who fail to respond to optimal damage control resuscitation (DCR), and there is an opportunity to formulate clinical practice guidelines to guide clinicians in implementing trauma ECMO at the bedside.
The Chinese Society of Extracorporeal Life Support (CSECLS) convened a domestic panel of interdisciplinary experts to develop this guideline, adhering to the principles of the World Health Organization (WHO) Manual for Guideline Development and the policy of conflict of interest. Clinical key questions pertaining to trauma ECMO use were informed from expert interviews and literature reviews, and formulated as PICO (Population/Intervention/Comparison/Outcome) format for literature retrieval of original studies supporting the question. Then, panelists were assigned to address specific clinical questions, synthesize evidence, formulate recommendations and determine their strength, following the Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. The guideline steering committee and stakeholders approved the final document.
Eleven recommendations regarding trauma ECMO use in adult patients were formulated, focusing on the following topics: (1) indications; (2) patient screening; (3) timing of initiation; (4) multidisciplinary approach; (5) trauma ECMO management; and (6) complication prevention. Supporting evidences are elaborated in detail, and expert opinions on clinical application and future research provided.
Although the quality of the body of evidence is low to very-low, most researches have shown that ECMO improves the survival of adult trauma patients with varied injury mechanisms. However, decision-making should consider the individual characteristics, benefits and potential harms, patients’ values and preferences, and long-term outcomes.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-26">摘要</h3>
<p>Maternal morbidity and mortality, encompassing pregnancy-related complications and obstetric disorders, pose a persistent global health challenge with significant multigenerational consequences. As the second leading cause of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) among women of reproductive age globally, these conditions exert profound impacts on perinatal outcomes and intergenerational health equity. The Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD), recognized as the most comprehensive epidemiological surveillance system, provides critical evidence for optimizing maternal health policies through systematic quantification of disease burden patterns. This multinational study employs GBD 2021 data to conduct a spatiotemporal analysis of maternal disorder burden across 21 GBD regions and 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021, utilizing standardized metrics including DALYs, prevalence rates, and mortality incidence.
This population-based multinational investigation employed systematically collected epidemiological evidence from the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD), Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2021, with data acquisition was conducted through the standardized Global Health Data Exchange platform ( https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/.GBD Results Tool; data retrieval date: November 11, 2024). We systematically analyzed temporal trends in maternal disorder burden from 1990 to 2021 using a standardized analytical framework stratified across three dimensions: age cohorts (10-54 years), 21 GBD-defined geographical regions, and socio-demographic index (SDI) quintiles-a composite metric integrating income, education, and fertility rates. The burden quantification employed five core metrics: (1) Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs): Integrating years of life lost (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs). (2) Mortality counts: Absolute maternal deaths by etiology. (3) Estimated annual percentage change (EAPC). (4) Age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR). (5) Age-standardized DALYs rate (ASDR): Adjusted using the GBD reference population structure. All estimates reported with 95% uncertainty interval (UI) derived from 1,000 Bayesian posterior draws.
Quantitative analysis of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 dataset reveals significant advancements in maternal health metrics. Between 1990 and 2021, maternal mortality decreased by 60% (age-standardized mortality rate [ASMR]: 12.45 to 4.87 per 100,000), with disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) declining by 43.5% (age-standardized DALY rate [ASDR]: 780.8 to 315.3 per 100,000). The estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) for mortality (-3.1%, 95% CI: -3.2 to -2.99) and DALYs (-3.0%, 95% CI: -3.1 to -2.89) underscores sustained global progress. Maternal abortion and miscarriage (-4.67% EAPC), Maternal hemorrhage (-4.06% EAPC), and Maternal obstructed labor and uterine rupture (-3.68% EAPC) drove maternal mortality reductions. Maternal mortality peaked at ages 20-24 globally, with variations in high-income regions (peaks at 25-34 years). Hemorrhage dominated in sub-Saharan Africa, whereas high-income regions prioritized hypertensive disorder management. The highest maternal mortality remained in low-SDI regions, with a substantial 63% decrease (51.85 to 19.44 per 100,000), while high-SDI regions showed minimal changes. Disease burden from hemorrhage, hypertensive disorders, and abortion declined significantly, while ectopic pregnancy saw stagnation. Regional trends revealed substantial improvements in Southern Asia, while Sub-Saharan Africa remained challenged.
The significant decline in global maternal mortality and DALYs over the past three decades highlights the progress made in improving maternal health. However, the persistent disparities across regions and SDI levels underscore the need for targeted interventions. The findings emphasize the importance of continued surveillance and monitoring of maternal health indicators to guide policy and resource allocation. Strengthening the healthcare systems, particularly in low-SDI regions, is crucial to further reduce the burden of maternal disorders.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-27">摘要</h3>
<p>Evaluations of integrated care models for frailty anchored by comprehensive geriatric assessment have reported mixed effects on patient outcomes. Various reasons have been proposed, including how implementation varies widely across different contexts. This paper aims to identify the key enablers and constraints that influenced the implementation of a novel community-based frailty programme- the Geriatric Services Hub- in the rapidly ageing nation-state of Singapore through the perspectives of programme leaders and implementers from five sites.
Seventy-four programme leaders and implementers were recruited for in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. The Framework Method was used to summarise and compare data across different sites and perspectives.
The findings on enablers and constraints were organised into four domains: System, partnership, programme and patient factors. Systemic factors include differing subsidies across public and private healthcare providers, systemic constraints of primary-care partners, a fragmented system of care, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Partnership factors include how capability-building for primary-care and community partners was welcomed by stakeholders. At the programme level, ensuring physical, financing, and timely access to services by frail older adults was prioritised. However, as noted under patient factors, some GSH patients faced complex medical, social, and financial issues that may affect service utilisation.
Systemic factors had a major influence on the implementation of GSH and we posit that they hold particular relevance for integrated care models in complex healthcare systems. Whole-system changes above and beyond implementation efforts of individual programmes may be needed for successful and sustainable implementation of integrated care.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-28">摘要</h3>
<p>Fractional dosing of vaccines is a viable strategy to extend COVID-19 vaccine supplies in resource-constrained settings. We did a triple-blinded, multi-site, randomized non-inferiority trial in Nigeria (PACTR202206754734018). Adults 18-65 years received full, half, or quarter primary doses of ChAdOx1 or Ad26.COV2.S, or full vs half doses of BNT162b2. Primary study outcome was seroconversion defined as ≥ 2.5-fold rise in anti-Spike IgG geometric-mean fold rise (GMFR) at day 28. A total of 1894 participants were enrolled between June 21, 2022, and January 25, 2023. 320 participants in the fractional dose group and 220 in the standard dose group completed follow-up and were included in the analysis. Seropositivity at baseline was high, at 68% (365/539). Seroconversion was comparable between standard and fractional doses (p = 0.822). For ChAdOx1, 31% achieved seroconversion at standard dose (16/52), 28% at half-dose (15/53), and 34% in quarter-dose (18/53). For Ad26.COV2.S, the proportions were 27% (28/105), 32% (22/68), and 30% (21/71) respectively. For BNT162b2, the proportions were 43% (27/63) and 39% (29/75) for standard- and half-dose. Serum neutralization showed ≥ twofold response across dosing. There were no serious adverse events. Fractional vaccine doses generated non-inferior immune responses compared to standard doses in the context of previous COVID-19.Protocol Registration: The protocol was registered with the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry (PACTR) PACTR202206754734018.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-29">摘要</h3>
<p>Stroke is a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality, disproportionately impacting lower socioeconomic groups. In this study, we evaluated three generative LLMs-GPT, Claude, and Gemini-across four stages of stroke care: prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation. Using three prompt engineering techniques-Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL), Chain of Thought (COT), and Talking Out Your Thoughts (TOT)-we applied each to realistic stroke scenarios. Clinical experts assessed the outputs across five domains: (1) accuracy; (2) hallucinations; (3) specificity; (4) empathy; and (5) actionability, based on clinical competency benchmarks. Overall, the LLMs demonstrated suboptimal performance with inconsistent scores across domains. Each prompt engineering method showed strengths in specific areas: TOT does well in empathy and actionability, COT was strong in structured reasoning during diagnosis, and ZSL provided concise, accurate responses with fewer hallucinations, especially in the Treatment stage. However, none consistently met high clinical standards across all stroke care stages.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-30">摘要</h3>
<p>Paratuberculosis (PTB), caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP), is a contagious and chronic enteric disease of ruminants and many non-ruminants leading to emaciation and death of the animal. PTB is poorly investigated in sheep and goats in Sudan, where these animals contribute significantly to food security and poverty alleviation as sources of income. They also play an important role in the national economy through animal exports. The objectives of this study were to investigate the prevalence of PTB and associated risk factors in small ruminants. Blood and faecal samples were collected from 818 sheep and goats aged &gt; 1 year in 111 flocks distributed over five states (Blue Nile, West Kordofan, Khartoum, the Gezira and White Nile) of the country from November 2020 to October 2022. Serum samples were tested by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of MAP antibodies and the faecal samples were tested for MAP DNA using a recombinase aided amplification (RAA) assay.
The overall true animal-level prevalence of PTB was 10.7% by RAA (4.2% in sheep, 6.5% in goats) and 1.7% by ELISA (0.7% in sheep, 1.0% in goats). At the flock level, prevalence was 41.8% by RAA and 8.5% by ELISA. While no significant associations were found between animal-level factors and PTB, several flock-level factors including breed homogeneity, source of new animals, management system, animal movement, separation of sick animals, and flock history of PTB were significantly associated with MAP detection (P &lt; 0.05).
The high flock-level prevalence of MAP DNA indicates a potential risk for environmental dissemination, especially under open grazing systems. Despite the relatively low seroprevalence, molecular detection suggests subclinical infection may be underdiagnosed. These findings highlight the importance of using combined diagnostic methods for effective PTB surveillance and control. Improved flock management practices are recommended to reduce MAP transmission and environmental contamination.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-31">摘要</h3>
<p>The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Korea has risen in recent years, yet many cases remain undiagnosed. Advanced artificial intelligence models using multi-modal data have shown promise in disease prediction, but two major challenges persist: the scarcity of samples containing all desired data modalities and class imbalance in T2DM datasets. We propose a novel transfer learning framework to predict T2DM onset within five years, using two Korean cohorts (KoGES and SNUH). To utilize unpaired multi-modal data, our approach transfers knowledge between clinical and genetic domains, leveraging unpaired clinical data alongside paired data. We also address class imbalance by applying a positively weighted binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss and a weighted random sampler (WRS). The transfer learning framework improved T2DM prediction performance. Using WRS and weighted BCE loss increased the model’s balanced accuracy and AUC (achieving test AUC 0.8441). Furthermore, combining transfer learning with intermediate data fusion yielded even higher performance (test AUC 0.8715). These enhancements were achieved despite limited paired multi-modal samples. Our framework effectively handles scarce paired data and class imbalance, leading to improved T2DM risk prediction. This approach can be adapted to other medical prediction tasks and integrated with additional data modalities, potentially aiding earlier diagnosis and better disease management in clinical settings.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-32">摘要</h3>
<p>Educating pregnant women about health-promoting behaviors is essential for achieving optimal pregnancy outcomes. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies are increasingly used to enhance healthcare delivery and support positive lifestyle changes. However, for these interventions to be effective, they must align with users’ socio-cultural contexts and expectations. This study aims to design, validate, and evaluate a culturally sensitive mHealth application for prenatal health promotion, guided by the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). An exploratory sequential mixed-methods design will be employed in three phases. In Phase 1, qualitative data will be collected through in-depth interviews with 15-20 pregnant women and healthcare experts to explore factors influencing the adoption of mHealth technologies. Data will be analyzed using directed content analysis based on the UTAUT model, following the approach proposed by Elo and Kyngäs. In Phase 2, the app will be developed using the ADDIE instructional design model. Findings from Phase 1 and a comprehensive literature review will inform the design of a prototype. The app will undergo expert review and user testing for content validation and usability assessment. In Phase 3, a randomized controlled trial will be conducted with 60 pregnant women recruited from public health clinics. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the intervention group (receiving the mHealth app) or the control group (receiving standard prenatal care) for one month. Outcomes will be assessed using the Modified Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile for Pregnancy (both groups) and the UTAUT-based Technology Acceptance Questionnaire (intervention group only). Data will be analyzed using SPSS version 23. A mixed-methods integration strategy will be used to interpret results, illustrating how qualitative findings inform and elaborate the quantitative outcomes. This protocol outlines the development of a theory-driven, user-centered mHealth intervention designed for pregnant women. The use of a mixed-methods approach ensures that the app reflects user needs and evaluates its effectiveness in promoting maternal health behaviors, with potential implications for improving maternal and fetal health outcomes.Trial registration: The trial is registered at https//irct.behdasht.gov.ir (identifier IRCT ID IRCT20180412039276N2, registered on 23.05.2022).</p>

<h3 id="摘要-33">摘要</h3>
<p>Despite the critical role of DNA methylation, clinical implementations harnessing its promise have not been described in acute myeloid leukemia. Utilizing DNA methylation from 3314 leukemia patient samples across 11 harmonized cohorts, we describe the Acute Leukemia Methylome Atlas, which includes robust models capable of accurately predicting AML subtypes. A genome-wide prognostic model as well as a targeted panel of 38 CpGs significantly predict five-year survival in our pediatric and adult test cohorts. To accelerate rapid clinical utility, we develop a specimen-to-result protocol that uses long-read nanopore sequencing and machine learning to characterize patients’ whole genomes and epigenomes. Clinical validation on patient samples confirms high concordance between epigenomic signatures and genomic lesions, though uniquely rare karyotypes remained challenging due to limited available training data. These results unveil the potential for increased affordability, speed, and accuracy for patients in need of complex molecular diagnosis and prognosis.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-34">摘要</h3>
<p>A new lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) analog has recently been identified, 1-[3-(Trimethylsilyl)propanoyl] LSD (1S-LSD), characterized by a silicon-containing acyl moiety. In the proof of LSD analog consumption, direct detection of the parent compound in urine or blood can be challenging; therefore, characteristic metabolites as consumption markers should be detected. However, the metabolic fate is unclear. This study aimed to characterize the metabolic properties of 1S-LSD.
The synthesized 1S-LSD was incubated with human liver microsomes. The obtained metabolites were analyzed using liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
The parent compound was metabolized at a moderately rapid rate, with the early formation of LSD. Sixty-two metabolites were observed, and a metabolic pathway was proposed. The major metabolites were compounds with hydroxyl groups in the 3-silylpropanoyl moiety. Five metabolites were relatively abundant and retained their 3-silylpropanoyl moieties: N-deethylated 1S-LSD (Si04), N-deethylated and silanolized 1S-LSD (Si06), N-deethylated and monohydroxylated 1S-LSD (Si09 and Si11), and silanolized 1S-LSD (Si21).
The metabolic fate of 1S-LSD, an abused drug containing silicon, was characterized for the first time. The diverse metabolic pathways will help better understand the metabolic processes of not only 1S-LSD but also N1-acylated LSD analogs and compounds with trimethylsilyl groups. Si04, Si06, Si09, Si11, and Si21 are potential target analytes for proving 1S-LSD consumption.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-35">摘要</h3>
<p>The intersectoral workplace intervention “health in work” (HIW), developed by the Norwegian healthcare service and labour and welfare administration, targets common musculoskeletal and mental health conditions by addressing both health and work environment factors. This study assessed the effectiveness of HIW on workers’ health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and subjective wellbeing (SWB) compared to standard inclusive work measures (IWM). A pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial including 97 workplaces, randomized to either the HIW or IWM intervention over 12 months. HRQoL was measured using the EQ-5D-5L and the EQ-VAS, and SWB by using the satisfaction with life scale and a question on meaningful life. Measurements were taken at baseline, post-intervention period, and at a 12-month follow-up. EQ-5D-5L data were analysed using mixed-effects generalized linear models. No statistically significant difference-in-difference in HRQoL or SWB were found between the HIW and IWM groups at any time point. Participants in both groups reported high baseline levels of HRQoL and SWB. Although HIW did not yield significant improvements or detriments in HRQoL or SWB, this study contributes to addressing the knowledge gap regarding intersectoral collaboration in enhancing work and health. Further research is needed to assess broader outcomes such as healthcare utilisation and sick leave.Trial registration: The trial was prospectively registered with ClinicalTrials.gov on June 24, 2019, under the identifier NCT04000035.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted older adult volunteering. It is important to understand if prior relationships between volunteering and health remain consistent in a post-pandemic context. We surveyed Oasis tutors aged 51 and older before and after two years of volunteering and matched them with a comparison group of non-volunteers in the 2016 and 2018 waves of the Health and Retirement Study. G-computation was then used on the merged sample (N = 518) to estimate the effect of volunteering on depression, functional limitations, and self-rated health. With all three matching algorithms, Oasis tutors experienced lower levels of depression and fewer functional limitations, compared to the HRS group of non-volunteers. When using nearest-neighbor matching, Oasis tutors had better self-rated health than the HRS comparison group. The Oasis Intergenerational Tutoring Program is positively associated with older adults’ health, supporting the social model of health promotion.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-38">摘要</h3>
<p>Senescent cells, characterized by irreversible cell cycle arrest and inflammatory factor secretion, promote various age-related pathologies. Senescent cells exhibit resistance to ferroptosis, a form of iron-dependent cell death; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we discovered that lysosomal acidity was crucial for lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis induction by cystine deprivation. In senescent cells, lysosomal alkalinization causes the aberrant retention of ferrous iron in lysosomes, resulting in resistance to ferroptosis. Treatment with the V-ATPase activator EN6 restored lysosomal acidity and ferroptosis sensitivity in senescent cells. A similar ferroptosis resistance mechanism involving lysosomal alkalinization was observed in pancreatic cancer cell lines. EN6 treatment prevented pancreatic cancer development in xenograft and Kras mutant mouse models. Our findings reveal a link between lysosomal dysfunction and the regulation of ferroptosis, suggesting a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of age-related diseases.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-39">摘要</h3>
<p>Forest fires release toxic pollutants from burning vegetation, posing serious risks to human health. The Brazilian Pantanal-the world’s largest continuous wetland-is currently experiencing severe wildfires. This situation may lead to a spike in hospital admissions for respiratory and cardiovascular conditions. To assess the health impacts of these fires on local populations, we applied a generalized linear model incorporating geographic variables, including air quality and climate data. This approach allowed us to evaluate the relationship between active fire outbreaks and hospitalizations among residents of the Pantanal. Our results reveal a troubling pattern: an increase of 10 active fires is associated with a significant rise in daily hospitalizations. Over a 10-year period, the risk of respiratory hospitalizations rose by 23.2%, while cardiovascular hospitalizations increased by 22.3% for every 10 additional fires. These findings underscore the urgent need for preventive action. By forecasting the potential daily rise in hospital admissions, our study offers valuable insights to help Brazilian authorities implement fire mitigation strategies and strengthen the preparedness of the local healthcare system.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-40">摘要</h3>
<p>Food insecurity and other unmet social needs can contribute to adverse outcomes for mothers and newborns. Food is Medicine (FIM) approaches are promising for improving nutrition and preventing chronic disease but have not been explored fully among rural-dwelling pregnant people. Our objectives were to (1) assess the potential of FIM programs to improve perinatal dietary quality; (2) assess patient satisfaction and self-reported health status with various FIM options; and (3) identify barriers to healthy eating among rural perinatal patients experiencing food insecurity.
Pregnant patients identified via a validated screener as experiencing food insecurity were referred to a community health worker (CHW), offered nutrition education, and connected to one or more FIM supports. A range of FIM programs developed through clinic-community partnerships provided tailored support to meet individual patient needs. We surveyed patients who received FIM support(s) from Dec 2023 - March 2024 regarding their satisfaction with and dietary changes related to FIM support. We collected qualitative data on challenges to healthy eating during pregnancy and opportunities for program improvement.
In survey responses (n = 31), patients indicated high satisfaction with all FIM supports, especially more intensive options, and reported eating more vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and healthy proteins. 71% indicated a small positive change in diet quality, with home-delivered nutritionally tailored meals most likely to influence a larger positive change. The most common barriers to healthy eating included food preferences or aversions, transportation challenges, poor quality of available food, and limited time to cook or eat.
We identified strong potential for FIM interventions during pregnancy to improve diet quality and overall health. More research is needed to evaluate the effects of FIM programs on food security and dietary quality during pregnancy and to tailor the type and duration of food support.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-41">摘要</h3>
<p>Fundamental treatments for autoimmune gastritis (AIG) have not yet been established; thus, analyzing AIG pathogenesis in detail to obtain useful information for prognosis prediction and treatment is crucial. This study explored bacteria involved in AIG pathogenesis by focusing on the gastric microbiota composition. Gastric biopsy tissues were collected endoscopically from the gastric corpus and antrum of patients with AIG and chronic gastritis. Total DNA was extracted from gastric biopsy specimens and used for 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing analysis. Principal coordinate analysis of diversity using the weighted UniFrac distance revealed that following Helicobacter pylori eradication, the gastric bacterial composition of patients with AIG differed significantly from that of patients with chronic gastritis, exhibiting decreased Shannon index, Pielou’s evenness, and Simpson index of alpha diversity. The gastric microbiota of patients with AIG was characterized by an increased abundance of the genus Streptococcus and a reduced abundance of the genus Prevotella compared with that of patients with chronic gastritis.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-42">摘要</h3>
<p>The presence of antibiotic pollutants such as tetracycline (TC) in water bodies poses a major environmental and health concern due to their persistence and resistance to conventional treatment. To address this issue, a novel GAs/Bi2O3/ZIF-67 composite was synthesized and coated onto graphite plates using a spin-coating method. This composite was integrated into a planar microreactor system comprising conductive FTO glass and a PDMS spacer, designed to enhance photocatalytic performance through simultaneous application of a low-voltage electric current. The composite was characterized using XRD, UV-Vis-DRS, FTIR, PL, SEM, EDX, TEM, EIS, and Photocurrent techniques. Photocatalytic activity was evaluated under various operational parameters. Under optimized conditions (pH = 4, the concentration of TC/load of photocatalyst = 0.2 (mg.m2/g.L), and retention time = 360 s), applying 1.8 V increased degradation efficiency from 88 to 99% and reduced treatment time by 33%. A synergistic index of 1.66 confirmed the positive interaction between photocatalysis and electric current. Kinetic studies indicated that the reaction rate was the limiting factor. The system maintained an efficiency of over 80% for 780 min, exhibiting stable performance under flow reversal. These results demonstrate the system’s potential as a fast, scalable, and energy-efficient approach for treating industrial pharmaceutical wastewater.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-43">摘要</h3>
<p>True fruit flies (Diptera: Tephritidae) are among the most destructive pests of fruit and vegetables worldwide and are on the top of quarantine pest lists. To respond effectively to a fruit fly invasion, we need to identify the species rapidly and reliably to understand its biological features and guide response decisions. Molecular techniques have been used to improve the diagnostic ability circumventing many difficulties of morphological identification. However, the commonly used Cytochrome Oxidase I (COI) gene lacks sufficient variation to distinguish species within Bactrocera species complexes. Here we conducted mitochondrial genome sequencing to identify additional genetic markers that could aid diagnosis of Bactrocera fruit fly species.
We assembled 82 complete mitochondrial genomes from 16 Bactrocera species, including 13 species for which no mitochondrial genome data were previously available, as well as one species each from Dacus aneuvittatus, Dirioxa pornia and Zeugodacus gracilis. Phylogenetic analysis of the Tephritidae family confirmed the monophyly of the Bactrocera genus but could not properly resolve species within species complexes. Comparative mitochondrial genome analysis revealed that intergenic spacer and NADH dehydrogenase genes, specifically ND2 and ND6, harbour enough variations for new specific real-time PCR assays. Based on these findings, six TaqMan-based real-time PCR assays targeting ND2, COI, and CO3 genes were successfully designed and assessed for their specificity and sensitivity in detecting Bactrocera curvipennis, a member of the B. tryoni complex. Of these, one real-time PCR assay targeting the ND2 gene proved to be the most specific and sensitive. It detects B. curvipennis specifically at the level of 1 copy/µL of target DNA.
Mitochondrial sequence analysis and comparative studies indicate that mitochondrial genomes offer valuable genetic markers for accurate diagnosis of Bactrocera fruit flies. The successful development of the B. curvipennis real-time PCR assay highlights the importance of having additional genetic markers to advance the molecular diagnostics in economically important Bactrocera species.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-44">摘要</h3>
<p>Soil degradation and nutrient deficiencies often limit soybean productivity and soil health. Biochar has emerged as a sustainable soil amendment to improve crop growth and soil health. Gyttja biochar is an innovative soil amendment with high organic matter and balanced nutrient contents compared to conventional biochar. Nonetheless, the ability of gyttja biochar to improve soybean growth and soil health is poorly investigated. Therefore, this study investigated the role of gyttja biochar in improving soybean growth and soil chemical health.
A greenhouse pot experiment was conducted using soil amended with gyttja-derived biochar at four concentrations [0.0% (control),1.5%, 3.0%, and 4.5%] to infer their impacts on growth and biochemical attributes of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], and soil chemical health. Growth parameters (plant height and biomass) and plant biochemical attributes (e.g., chlorophyll index, stomatal conductance, proline, malondialdehyde contents, and antioxidant enzyme activity) were analyzed. Post-harvest soil samples were analyzed for chemical properties including pH, electrical conductivity, and activities of catalase, urease, and dehydrogenase enzymes.
Gyttja biochar significantly improved soybean growth and biochemical attributes compared to the control treatment. Growth traits were significantly increased (plant height by 20.9%, root length by 29.2%, and plant weight by 84.9%) with 4.5% concentration, and leaves showed greater chlorophyll index. Biochar-treated plants also exhibited increased antioxidant enzyme activities and lower oxidative stress indicators, reflecting improved plant health. Soil pH and electrical conductivity improved by 5.9% and 33.2%, respectively. Soil enzyme activities significantly increased, and urease activity nearly doubled compared to the control.
Gyttja-derived biochar significantly improved soybean growth, biochemical attributes, and soil chemical health. These results indicate that converting gyttja sediment into biochar could improve crop productivity and soil fertility, providing an environmentally friendly approach to enhance agroecosystem health. Future research should include long-term, multi-season field trials to validate these results under varied environmental conditions, assess economic feasibility, and evaluate the effects of gyttja biochar across diverse soil types and soybean genotypes.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-45">摘要</h3>
<p>The African BioGenome Project (AfricaBP) is a Pan-African initiative aimed at improving food systems and biodiversity conservation through genomics while ensuring equitable data sharing and benefits. The Open Institute is the knowledge exchange platform of the AfricaBP, which aims to bridge local knowledge gaps in biodiversity genomics and bioinformatics and enable infrastructural developments. In 2024, the AfricaBP Open Institute advanced this mission by organizing 31 workshops that attracted more than 3500 registered attendees across 50 African countries, provided training to 401 African researchers in genomics, bioinformatics, molecular biology, sample collections and biobanking, and ethical considerations, across all five African geographical regions involving 40 African and non-African organizations. These workshops provide insights on applications of biodiversity genomics and bioinformatics to the African bioeconomy, as well as hands-on training in sample collection and processing, genomics, bioinformatics, molecular biology, and gene editing. Here, we provide the current understanding of the applications of biodiversity genomics and bioinformatics to the African bioeconomy through synthetic reviews and presentations, including descriptions of 31 workshops organized as well as three fellowship programs delivered or launched by the AfricaBP Open Institute in collaboration with African and international institutions and industry partners. We review the current national bioeconomy strategies across Africa and the economic impact of sequencing African genomes locally, illustrated by a case study on the proposed 1000 Moroccan Genome Project. Key recommendations include integrating biodiversity genomics and bioinformatics into national bioeconomy strategies, leveraging genomics for sustainable bioeconomy growth, and expanding capacity-building initiatives across Africa.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-46">摘要</h3>
<p>COVID-19 had a devastating impact on humanity. We investigated how residential air pollution (ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), fine particulate matter (PM2.5)) and meteorological factors (temperature (Temp), precipitation (Prec)) are associated with COVID-19 incidence in Baden-Württemberg (BW), Germany. We utilized data from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service and the Copernicus Climate Change Service to model environmental exposure from 2020 to 2022 in postal code areas in BW. Health insurance data on SARS-CoV-2 infections were provided from the health insurance AOK BW on a quarterly level covering approximately 12 million person-years. We examined the spatiotemporal variability with a generalized additive model including various stressors, demographic factors, and area-wide data, offering a comprehensive analysis of the environmental stressor- COVI-10 incidence associations. In 2022, during the prevalence of the Omicron variant, the number of COVID-19 cases tripled compared to 2020. During the pre-Omicron period, COVID-19 incidence showed a positive association with PM2.5 (relative risk [RR] 2.41; 95% confidence interval [CI] (2.31, 2.52)), a negative association with Temp (RR 0.39 (0.32, 0.48)), and no clear or slight associations with O3, Prec, and NO2. During the Omicron period, there were either no clear or slight negative associations with Temp (RR 0.92 (0.74, 1.30)), PM2·5 (RR 0.70 (0.64, 0.79)), NO2, and Prec and a negative association with O3 (RR 0.46 (0.40, 0.53)). The analysis found clear links between environmental stressors and COVID-19 incidence, which strongly differed between pre-Omicron and Omicron periods. Consideration of environmental stressor concentration could be relevant in the management of the pandemic.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-47">摘要</h3>
<p>Severe symptoms in the absence of measurable body pathology are a frequent hallmark of post-COVID syndrome. From a Bayesian Brain perspective, such symptoms can be explained by incorrect internal models that the brain uses to interpret sensory signals. In this pre-registered study, we investigate whether induced breathlessness perception during a controlled CO2rebreathing challenge is reflected by altered respiratory measures (physiology and breathing patterns), and propose different computational mechanisms that could explain our findings in a Bayesian Brain framework. We analysed data from 40 patients with post-COVID syndrome and 40 healthy participants. Results from lung function, neurological and neurocognitive examination of all participants were within normal limits on the day of the experiment. Using a Bayesian repeated-measures ANOVA, we found that patients’ breathlessness was strongly increased (BF10,baseline=8.029, BF10,rebreathing=11636, BF10,recovery=43662) compared to controls. When excluding patients who hyperventilated (N = 8, 20%) during the experiment from the analysis, differences in breathlessness remained (BF10,baseline=1.283, BF10,rebreathing=126.812, BF10,recovery=751.282). For physiology and breathing patterns, all evidence pointed towards no difference between the two groups (0.307 &gt; BF10 &lt; 0.704). In summary, we found intact breathing patterns and physiology but increased symptom perception in patients with post-COVID syndrome.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-48">摘要</h3>
<p>Influenza vaccination remains one of the best tools available to prevent severe disease in individuals at high risk of influenza complications. Yet, influenza vaccination among older adults and those at high risk of severe outcomes has remained low in Canada and other countries even when the vaccine is routinely recommended. Assessing the prevalence of influenza vaccination coverage over time and factors associated with missed vaccination can provide evidence to inform efforts to improve coverage. Among adults aged ≥ 65 years and adults aged 49-64 years with one or more chronic medical condition (CMC), we aimed to (1) estimate the prevalence of missed influenza vaccination and (2) evaluate factors associated with missed vaccination using recent data from a large national survey of Canadian adults.
We analyzed data collected by the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging during follow-up 2 from 2018 to 2021. Participants were asked to self-report whether they received an influenza vaccine in the year prior to completing the survey. We estimated the prevalence of missed vaccination overall and by participant characteristics. We assessed factors associated with missed vaccination using logistic regression and report adjusted odds ratios among adults aged ≥ 65 years and adults aged 49-64 years with ≥ 1 CMC.
Among the 18,894 participants surveyed, 27.0% (95% CI: 26.1, 27.8%) of those aged 65 years and older and 45.2% (95% CI: 43.7, 46.8%) of those aged 49-64 years with ≥ 1 CMC reported not receiving influenza vaccination within the prior year. For both groups, reporting receiving influenza vaccination in the previous CLSA wave of data collection (2015-2017) and contact with a family doctor within the prior year were strongly associated with lower odds of missed influenza vaccination.
Our analysis suggests that a large proportion of eligible Canadian adults at higher risk of severe complications due to influenza are not receiving a seasonal influenza vaccine, despite recommendations. These estimates and this detailed analysis provide important insights into trends in influenza vaccination coverage among older adults and can serve as a baseline assessment for tracking changes in influenza vaccination coverage over time and in the years following the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-49">摘要</h3>
<p>Using unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods, we aimed to identify clinically relevant groups of employees with similar characteristics and analyze the association of long and short sickness absence periods with these groups.
The participants were 12,099 employees of various occupations in Finnish companies. The data comprised 104 variables from medical records including data on sickness absences and a questionnaire used between 2011 and 2019 in health examinations. The latent dimensions for the employees were defined by principal component analysis to reduce the number of variables. Clusters were calculated using the K-means algorithm from datapoints expressed by the resulting five principal components. Logistic regression analyses were used to assess the associations of the clusters with long (&gt; 30 days) and repetitive short (1-10 days) sickness absence (SA) episodes.
Employees in cluster one indicated positive managerial performance and workplace atmosphere, and employees had the least of both short and long SA. Cluster two indicated deficiencies related to managerial performance and workplace atmosphere. Cluster three had deficiencies mainly related to mood and depression and cluster four had cardiovascular diseases. Employees in cluster five reported many symptoms, especially dizziness and sensory symptoms, and had the highest occurrence of repetitive short SA. Cluster six indicated deficiencies related to work ability and had the highest occurrence of a long SA episode during follow-up.
Unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods identified six clinically coherent employee clusters, providing information on typical combinations of characteristics and risk profiles of sickness absence.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-50">摘要</h3>
<p>Peripheral intravenous catheter (PIVC) care in Australia remains suboptimal and continues to cause harm. Gaps in local policy, variation in clinician training and competing clinical priorities all continue to lead to poor PIVC practices and associated complications.
A priority setting study was undertaken with the aim of identifying infection prevention and control priorities for PIVC care and key actionable strategies that would facilitate effective improvements in PIVC practices.
Sixty-five multidisciplinary clinicians participated in the study. Nine priority themes were identified with key actionable strategies including greater consumer engagement, development of standardised and evidence-informed resources, and strong national leadership for PIVC care improvement.
This study provides valuable knowledge from clinicians with an in-depth understanding of the clinical factors contributing to poor PIVC practices. Efforts to improve these practices and address the key themes identified will depend on strong leadership and a coordinated approach across the system.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-51">摘要</h3>
<p>Adolescents face significant challenges to healthy development. A key step in designing effective health education programs for adolescents is the ability to assess and identify individual needs in a particular area of health. This cross-sectional study evaluated the psychometric properties of an adapted self-report measure assessing self-efficacy for health practices among adolescents, the Self-Efficacy for Health Practices Scale (SEHPS).
Items for the SEHPS were adapted from a measure designed for adults, the Self-Rated Abilities for Health Practices Scale. Items were adapted for use with adolescents, and additional items were created to measure another dimension of health not included in the adult scale. 438 adolescents from three school districts in west Texas completed the instrument. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed using principal axis factor analysis with oblique rotation to analyze the factor structure of the SEHPS. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was employed to confirm the factor structure identified by the EFA. Reliability, convergent, and discriminant validity analyses were also performed.
The analysis supported a five-factor solution measuring psychological well-being, nutrition, exercise, health practices, and physical safety. Combined, the five factors explained 62.7 % of the variance. Results from the CFA indicated a good model fit and satisfactory reliability, as well as convergent and discriminant validity.
Results suggest that the scale is a valid and reliable instrument to assess adolescents’ self-efficacy beliefs to implement health practices. The SEHPS is a valuable tool for nurses and other healthcare professionals seeking to design, implement, and evaluate health-focused interventions for adolescents.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-52">摘要</h3>
<p>Indium-tin oxide nanoparticles (Nano-ITO) are widely used in various applications as infrared shielding materials, which increase the risk of occupational exposure. According to reports, Nano-ITO can cause indium lung disease in occupational exposed workers, but the specific mechanism of Nano-ITO-induced pulmonary toxicity remains unclear. In this study, 50 8-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five groups (10 rats in each group) as follows: control group (physiological saline), 1.2 mg/kg Nano-ITO group, 6 mg/kg Nano-ITO group, N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine (NAC) control group (200 mg/kg), and NAC + Nano-ITO group (200 mg/kg NAC intraperitoneal injection, after 1.5 h, 6 mg/kg Nano-ITO intratracheal instillation), twice a week for 12 weeks. Pathological and ultrastructural changes in the rat lung tissue, immunofluorescence assays, immunohistochemistry, protein and mRNA levels of apoptosis- and autophagy-related genes were measured. The levels of ROS, MDA, H2O2, and LDH, and the activities of T-AOC and SOD, were determined using oxidative stress assay kits. The results showed that Nano-ITO caused strong pulmonary inflammation, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis. In addition, Nano-ITO-induced oxidative stress in rat lungs presented as increased levels of ROS and H2O2 in the lungs, increased LDH and MDA levels, SOD and T-AOC activity in BALF, and activation of the Nrf2/NQO1/HO-1 signaling pathway. Intriguingly, Nano-ITO significantly increased the protein expression of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3-II), the protein levels of autophagy-related genes 5 (ATG5), and Beclin-1 (BECN1), and reduced the protein levels of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) in lung tissues. In addition, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed a significant increase in autophagic vesicles in the cytoplasm of lungs treated with Nano-ITO, indicating that Nano-ITO induces autophagy in rat lungs. Moreover, apoptosis also participates in Nano-ITO-induced pulmonary injury in a synchronous manner, as evidenced by the enhancement of TUNEL-positive signals and activation of the apoptosis pathway (Bax and Bcl-2 positive proportions). NAC supplementation restored most of the pathological structural features of rat lung tissue to their physiological range and effectively weakened apoptosis, as demonstrated by the notable reductions in TUNEL, Bax, and Bcl-2 protein expression levels in the lungs. Although autophagy was detected in the lungs of rats in the Nano-ITO and NAC + Nano-ITO groups, we discovered that NAC could rescue the expression of ATG5 and BECN1 induced by Nano-ITO, thus indicating that exposure to Nano-ITO promotes pulmonary apoptosis and autophagy by mediating oxidative stress. These results indicate that Nano-ITO can cause pulmonary injury by inducing oxidative stress, which activates apoptosis and autophagy, ultimately leading to alveolar proteinosis and interstitial fibrosis.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-53">摘要</h3>
<p>The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic were not equally distributed, with emerging research demonstrating that racialized and immigrant populations in Canada have been disproportionately affected. Drawing on the risk-focusing hypothesis, a theoretical lens that explicates how risk burden concentrates disproportionately in marginalized populations, government mitigation strategies such as shutdowns can be seen as exacerbating existing social and economic challenges, making individuals more susceptible to COVID-19 and its adverse outcomes. This paper examines the economic and occupational challenges experienced by individuals from racialized and/or immigrant populations in the Peel Region (Ontario, Canada) during COVID-19 shutdowns. Semi-structured interviews (n = 46) were conducted from October to December 2021, discussing participants’ experiences throughout the pandemic. Using thematic analysis, interviews were coded for concepts related to employment, economics, and government support. Semantic codes were grouped into categories, where themes were identified and refined. Loss of work and difficulties in securing employment were primary themes across interviews, with participants discussing taking on low-skill “survival jobs” to pay the bills. Participants spoke of being worried about finances and decreased mental health as a result. An additional theme was the pathways of risk that accompanied employment. While government economic and social programs were considered helpful, challenges were noted in navigating resources. This study highlights the importance of examining pandemic outcomes from a risk-focusing framework, to understand how certain groups were repeatedly put at risk.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-54">摘要</h3>
<p>The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increasing among the Hispanic/Latino population. Type 2 diabetes incidence rates vary between neighborhoods, but no single aspect of the neighborhood environment is known to cause type 2 diabetes. Using data from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos cohort of 16,415 Hispanic/Latino adults in four major US cities, we conducted a neighborhood environment-wide association study to identify neighborhood measures or clusters of measures associated with diabetes incidence. Two-hundred and four neighborhood measures were calculated at the census tract level or within a 1-km buffer of participants’ residential addresses. Independent covariate-adjusted and survey-weighted Poisson regressions were run for each neighborhood measure and incident diabetes. Principal component analysis of neighborhood measures was conducted to reduce dimensionality. No coherent pattern of neighborhood measures or principal component scores were associated with diabetes incidence within the cohort, though established individual-level risk factors such as age and family history were strongly associated with diabetes incidence. Results from our analysis did not indicate specific neighborhood measures, clusters, or patterns. Individual, rather than neighborhood, factors distinguish incident diabetes cases from non-cases.</p>
