<h2 id="article-1">1. Optimizing intraoperative video for surgical training: a comparative study of three recording techniques in hip arthroplasty.</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: Computer assisted surgery (Abingdon, England)
<strong>发表日期</strong>: 2025-Dec
<strong>链接</strong>: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40974608">PubMed</a></p>

<h3 id="摘要">摘要</h3>
<p>High-quality intraoperative video documentation is increasingly valued in surgery for its role in surgical evaluation, procedural archiving, and education. However, the comparative advantages of different recording methods have not been thoroughly examined. In this prospective, double-blinded study, 44 experienced orthopedic surgeons evaluated posterior total hip arthroplasty videos recorded using three techniques: a head-mounted camera, a light-handle-mounted camera, and an externally operated camera. All videos were captured by the same surgeon using standardized hardware and settings. Participants assessed video quality and educational value using a structured questionnaire. Data were analyzed using ANOVA and chi-square testing. The light-handle-mounted camera received the highest mean scores across all five evaluation domains, including visual clarity, image stability, and overall quality (mean scores ranging from 6.91 to 7.98). Repeated measures ANOVA confirmed statistically significant differences among the three camera techniques for all five questions (p = 0.022-0.043). Post hoc analysis revealed that the light-handle-mounted camera significantly outperformed the head-mounted system (p &lt; 0.05 for all comparisons), while the external camera also demonstrated superiority over the head-mounted method. Chi-square testing showed a significant difference in educational suitability ratings (Question 6), with the light-handle-mounted system receiving the highest percentage of affirmative responses (79.5%) compared to the head-mounted (50.0%) and external cameras (31.8%) (p &lt; 0.001). The light-handle-mounted system offered the most balanced solution, providing stable, high-quality recordings without disrupting sterility or workflow. While head-mounted and external methods have niche applications, their practical limitations reduce their suitability for routine documentation in procedures.</p>

<h2 id="article-2">2. Impact of patisiran on polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis in patients with a V122I or T60A variant: a phase IV multicenter study.</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: Annals of medicine
<strong>发表日期</strong>: 2025-Dec
<strong>链接</strong>: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40974604">PubMed</a></p>

<h3 id="摘要-1">摘要</h3>
<p>This study assessed the effectiveness and safety of patisiran in patients with V122I/T60A variant transthyretin (ATTRv) amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. These variants have been under-represented in previous trials of gene-silencing agents.
This was a multicenter, phase IV study conducted at 27 sites in the USA. Patients were ≥ 18 years, diagnosed with ATTRv amyloidosis with polyneuropathy and a documented V122I or T60A variant. Patisiran-treated patients were enrolled prospectively, ambispectively, and retrospectively. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a stable or improved polyneuropathy disability (PND) score at 12 months vs. baseline. Safety was monitored throughout the trial.
Sixty-seven patients were enrolled, of whom 58 received ≥ 1 dose of patisiran. In the efficacy population, 42/45 (93.3%) patients demonstrated stable or improved PND scores from baseline to Month 12. Patients also showed stable or improved quality of life, health status, autonomic symptoms, and cardiac function vs. baseline. Adverse events occurred in 13/42 (31.0%) patients in the prospective and ambispective cohorts; most were mild or moderate. No deaths or cardiac hospitalizations were considered related to patisiran.
Patisiran demonstrated a consistent positive effect across multiple endpoints in patients with V122I/T60A ATTRv amyloidosis, including polyneuropathy manifestations.</p>

<h2 id="article-5">5. Recent advances in nanoformulations for helminthiasis treatment.</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: Expert opinion on drug delivery
<strong>发表日期</strong>: 2025-Sep-20
<strong>链接</strong>: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40974615">PubMed</a></p>

<h3 id="摘要-4">摘要</h3>
<p>Recent advances in nanoformulations are reshaping the treatment landscape for helminthiasis by addressing critical challenges such as drug resistance, poor bioavailability, and off-target effects.
This review examines current innovations in nanotechnology applied to anthelmintic therapy, with a particular focus on lipid- and polymer-based systems designed to enhance drug solubility, stability, and targeted delivery. A comprehensive literature search was performed to identify recent developments, highlight preclinical and translational studies, and evaluate the performance of solid lipid nanoparticles, nanoemulsions, and self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems. Relevant articles were retrieved from peer-reviewed journals indexed in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, covering publications up to June 2025.
The integration of nanotechnologies into helminthiasis treatment offers promising therapeutic advantages but faces important challenges related to industrial scalability, regulatory approval, and implementation in low-resource settings. Addressing these issues requires coordinated efforts between academia, industry, and public health stakeholders. The review outlines key considerations for technology transfer and commercialization, underscoring the importance of cost-effectiveness, patient acceptability, and cross-sector collaboration to ensure the successful translation of nanomedicine-based solutions for neglected tropical diseases.</p>

A cross-sectional survey was conducted from May to June 2024 in five hospitals in Xinxiang City, China. The job competency and professional misconduct questionnaires were administered via the Questionnaire Star app, yielding 308 valid responses from physicians, nurses, and medical technicians.
Univariate analysis revealed significant differences in professional misconduct scores by gender (p = 0.001) and hospital level (p = 0.046). Pearson correlation analysis showed that males (r = -0.248, p &lt; 0.01) and higher competency levels (r = -0.164, p &lt; 0.01) were associated with reduced professional misconduct, while respondents working in higher-level hospitals (r = 0.121, p &lt; 0.05) had a higher incidence of professional misconduct. Regression analysis confirmed that gender (β = -0.241, p &lt; 0.001) and professional competence (β = -0.171, p = 0.002) were the primary influencing factors, while hospital level had a smaller impact (β = 0.101, p = 0.066).
In the era of AI, professional misconduct among healthcare workers is primarily influenced by gender, hospital level, and professional competence. It is recommended to control the occurrence of professional misconduct through measures such as implementing gender equality policies, providing tiered financial support, establishing a professional competence management system related to AI, and promoting self-assessment.
Gender-specific interventions: Given the significant correlation between gender and misconduct, targeted interventions focusing on male healthcare professionals could reduce the occurrence of professional misconduct. These interventions might include gender-sensitive training programmes and mental health support tailored to address specific challenges faced by male staff in the healthcare environment.Competence-based rehabilitation programmes: Since job competence is a key predictor in mitigating misconduct, enhancing the competencies of healthcare staff through ongoing education, skills training, and performance feedback can serve as an effective rehabilitation strategy. This would not only reduce misconduct but also improve overall healthcare service delivery.AI-driven monitoring systems: The introduction of AI-powered early warning systems in hospitals could assist in identifying potential risks related to professional misconduct. Such systems could serve as a rehabilitation tool by providing real-time data to hospital management, enabling proactive interventions.Psychological support for AI anxiety: Addressing AI-related anxiety, especially among healthcare workers in high-level hospitals, could be crucial in maintaining professional integrity. Implementing AI anxiety support programmes could reduce stress and improve mental health, thereby lowering the likelihood of misconduct.Holistic management framework: The proposed three-tier management framework (government, hospital, and individual) can serve as a rehabilitation model that fosters a supportive environment across different levels. Government-led policies focusing on gender impact and tiered funding can promote fairness, while hospital-level competency programmes and individual-focused self-diagnosis tools can directly contribute to reducing professional misconduct.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-6">摘要</h3>
<p>Mosquitoes are major vectors of disease and pose a significant threat to public health. Chemical insecticides face resistance and environmental issues, prompting the need for eco-friendly alternatives such as entomopathogenic fungi. However, their potential across mosquito life stages remains underexplored. As a primary malaria vector in East Asia, Anopheles sinensis remains understudied in terms of biological control approaches.
Four effective fungal strains were initially screened from 22 fungal isolates based on their pathogenicity against An. sinensis larvae. Among them, strain Metarhizium anisopliae (Ma)421 demonstrated the best overall performance when further assessed for its mosquito-killing activity at the egg, pupa and adult stages, as well as its sporulation capacity on mosquito cadavers. Fungal infection reduced hatching rates, impaired larval pupation and adult emergence, and caused morphological deformities in newly emerged adults-such as malformed wings and legs-ultimately leading to mortality. Further analysis of Ma421 revealed a significant suppression of blood-feeding behavior, reduced egg-laying, and lower hatching, pupation and adult emergence rates in the next generation. These findings indicated that Ma421 induced transgenerational effects by decreasing reproductive success in subsequent generation, which is an important finding with promising implications for sustainable mosquito control.
This study fills a significant gap in the fungal-based biological control of An. sinensis, with the multistage efficacy of Ma421 highlighting its potential for use in integrated vector management. Its transgenerational impact further underscores its potential as an eco-friendly alternative to chemical insecticides, supporting its incorporation into sustainable mosquito management strategies. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-7">摘要</h3>
<p>As people with intellectual disability live longer, the number of people living with dementia is increasing, creating an imperative to implement tailored post-diagnostic supports that enable identity, self-determination, quality of life and well-being. To inform the development of post-diagnostic guidance for persons with intellectual disability living with dementia, a qualitative descriptive study was undertaken to understand experiences of accessing and using post-diagnostic supports and desired future supports. Four main themes resulted: 1. Being me: a sense of self through connection and valued life pursuits; 2. Meeting the social and personal needs of the person; 3. Formal processes that support people living with intellectual disabilities and dementia; 4. Challenges in supporting people living with intellectual disabilities and dementia. Findings identified areas of importance to living well, emphasising sense of self, social connectedness and meeting changing needs and care requirements in varied contexts through collaborative pre-emptive planning centred on the person.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-8">摘要</h3>
<p>Social frailty is common and associated with several adverse outcomes in older adults. However, its prevalence and effects on mortality in younger populations and the underlying cause of mortality are poorly understood. To examine the association of social frailty with all-cause and cause-specific mortality in adults across a wide age spectrum, we used data from the UK Biobank, a prospective cohort included 421,644 individuals aged 37-73 years enrolled from 2006 to 2010. Social frailty status was assessed based on Bunt’s concept (financial difficulty, live alone, less social activity and rarely contacts with friends/family). The prevalence of pre-social frailty and social frailty were 35.74% and 19.87%, respectively, indicating that more than half of the participants were at risk of cumulative depletion of essential social resources. Both pre-social frailty and social frailty were associated with higher risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality (including malignant neoplasms, heart disease, cerebrovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, diabetes mellitus, and others caused) in adults across a wide age spectrum, independent of sociodemographic factors, lifestyles, chronic diseases, mental health, and physical frailty status. These findings indicate that social frailty, as a robust and multidimensional construct, effectively captures the risk of losing social resources. Thus, assessing and addressing social frailty can reduce mortality risk.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-9">摘要</h3>
<p>The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been increasingly recognized to be associated with carcinogenesis and cancer progression. There is extensive preclinical evidence suggesting the benefits of RAS-inhibiting drugs, such as angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), in preventing the progression of gastric cancer (GC). However, clinical evidence supporting the positive effects of ARBs and ACEIs on GC prognosis is currently limited. The purpose of this study is to investigate their effects in a Finnish cohort.
This is a retrospective national cohort study, where cancer patient registry data were linked to prescription purchase records for ARBs and ACEIs. The effect of ARB/ACEI in the post-diagnostic period on overall mortality was assessed using Cox regression analysis. Disease-specific mortality associations were evaluated with the Fine and Gray model.
We included 2246 histologically confirmed GC patients diagnosed between 2011 and 2016. Follow-up continued until the end of 2023. In the main analysis, a protective effect of ARB use was associated with a significant reduction in overall mortality (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69-0.94, p = 0.007). Furthermore, the effect was greater for those with higher ARB dosage. A similar finding was not observed with ACEI use. For disease-specific survival, both ARB and ACEI use had a significant protective effect (adjusted HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.90 p = 0.002 and adjusted HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.63-0.93, P = 0.007, respectively).
Our study adds to the evidence that ARB use might have a beneficial impact on survival among GC patients.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-10">摘要</h3>
<p>Small bowel (SB) capsule endoscopy (CE) is a well-established investigation for suspected SB pathology, but little research has evaluated the diagnostic miss rate of SB cancer. This Australian study sought to assess the risk of developing SB cancer within 36 months of a cancer-negative CE (PCSBC-3Y) using a novel root-cause analysis (RCA) method.
Using a prospective CE database and data linkage with a population-based state cancer registry, the PCSBC-3Y rate was evaluated in consecutive patients undergoing CE between 2007 and 2019. SB cancers diagnosed or suspected from CE were defined as ‘detected cancers’, whilst those diagnosed within 36 months of a negative CE were defined as ‘missed cancers’. Descriptive statistics summarised characteristics for all diagnosed SB cancers. All PCSBC-3Y cases were evaluated by RCA.
A total of 20 patients were diagnosed with SB cancer within 36 months of CE, comprising of 18 detected cancers and two missed cancers. The overall PCSBC-3Y rate was 10% (95% CI 2.6-28.7%). The two missed cancers included one jejunal gastrointestinal stromal tumour and one duodenal adenocarcinoma. RCA revealed both missed cancers to be unavoidable, as the SB was normal on two retrospective reviews of the CE video recordings.
This study introduces the concept of measuring the PCSBC-3Y rate and a novel algorithm of RCA. In our quaternary referral CE cohort, the PCSBC-3Y rate was 10%. A subsequent RCA suggested that the two missed cancers were unavoidable.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-11">摘要</h3>
<p>Gastrointestinal malignancies (GI malignancies) have had a notoriously dismal prognosis throughout history. The primary therapeutic approaches to treat and manage GI malignancies are immunotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, and chemotherapy, which may include monotherapy or a combination of these therapies to boost the effect. Nevertheless, the recurrence and metastasis rates remain elevated. In recent decades, immunotherapies have had a powerful impact when included in treatment regimens. In hematologic malignancy, chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T cell) have shown a promising anticancer impact as one of the immunotherapies. It gives a promising treatment option for solid tumors, including colorectal cancers. In recent clinical trials, the CAR-T cells showed a promising effect on pancreatic, colorectal, esophageal, hepatocellular, and gastric cancers. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy is another immunotherapy option with promising option for GI malignancies. Through the process of designing the TIL therapy, T cells are extracted and designed according to the nature of the GI malignancy. In this review, we addressed the clinical applications of both therapies while highlighting the challenges and possible strategies to overcome them. CAR T-cells and TIL therapies showed good responses with tolerable and acceptable side effects in treating GI malignancies such as pancreatic, colorectal, gastric, and hepatocellular cancers, while the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) inhibiting the activity of immunotherapy and impeding its efficacy is a significant challenge.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-12">摘要</h3>
<p>The present study evaluated the efficacy of albendazole in treating soil-transmitted helminth infections among school children aged 6 to 15 years in three districts of Central Tigray, Ethiopia. A total of 1020 elementary school children were screened from three schools using Kato-Katz and microscopic detection techniques. Of these, 35.2% (359/1020) of children were infected with one or more soil-transmitted helminths and were treated with 400 mg albendazole. The efficacy of the drug was assessed by measuring the percentage reduction in helminth egg counts using Kato-Katz. Albendazole was most effective against hookworm, with overall 94.1% egg reduction rates (ERRs), 3 weeks post-treatment followed by A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura, with overall ERRs of 83.9% and 31%, respectively. Analysis of factors affecting albendazole treatment success revealed that the age of respondents, source of drinking water, and infection intensity at baseline were significant predictors of treatment success. School children 6-8 years old showed higher ERRs, while those using stream water for drinking purposes and with multiple parasite infections at baseline had lower probability of ERRs. These findings demonstrate the varying efficacy of albendazole across different STH infections and geographical locations, calling a more refined research to enhance treatment approaches for A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura. This study underscores the need for context-specific therapeutic intervention to enhance treatment success in endemic areas.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-13">摘要</h3>
<p>Staphylococcus pseudintermedius is one of the main causes of bacterial infection in dogs, and resistant isolates that present zoonotic potential have also been identified. This study aimed to determine the genotypic profiles of Brazilian isolates of S. pseudintermedius from animals, and their population structures. S. pseudintermedius isolates (n = 50) were subjected to methicillin resistance analysis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and genotyping by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The mecA gene, which confers resistance to methicillin, was detected in 84% of the isolates (42/50), and the animal species of origin were 84% dogs, 8% cats, 2% porcine, 2% bovine, and 4% from wild animals. The main isolation sites were skin (38%), ear (26%), and urine (14%). Forty different sequence types (STs) were observed and 39 were described for the first time, including ST226, which, to our knowledge, is reported for the first time in a feline isolate. Three clonal complexes (CC) were present, and CC258 was predominant among the characterized isolates. The variety of STs in the isolates of S. pseudintermedius in this study indicates a high genetic diversity of this species in Brazil. Considering that only one of the observed STs (ST266) has been previously reported, it is likely that the new STs described are clones developed locally. In addition, the predominance and spread of the CC258 clonal complex in Brazil could be associated to resistance to methicillin, demonstrates the establishment of CC258 as a successful clone.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-14">摘要</h3>
<p>Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of severe bacterial infections, including pneumonia, meningitis, and bacteremia. We aimed to evaluate the differences in clinical, epidemiological and outcome manifestations of patients admitted with S. pneumoniae bacteremia (SPB) in the pre- and post-COVID-19 period.
The study analyzed all patients admitted in Province of Modena, Italy, during two time-periods: pre-COVID-19 (Jan 2018- Feb 2020) and post-COVID-19 (Mar 2020- Jun 2022) period. The data were compared using univariate and multivariate analysis.
A total of 150 patients with SPB were included, 109 and 41 patients in the pre- and post-COVID-19, respectively. We observed a decrease in SPB incidence from March 2020, after the implementation of the restrictive measures for the COVID-19 pandemic, and a new increase since Jun 2021, when lockdown measures were fully lifted. SPB was associated with pneumonia in 128 patients (85.3%), meningitis in 25 (16.7%) and otitis-mastoiditis in 14 (9.3%). The proportion of patients presenting with multi-lobar pneumonia significantly increased during the post-COVID-19 period (39.0% vs. 16.5%, p = 0.008). Thirty-day mortality rate resulted higher in the post-COVID-19 period (24.4% vs. 11.9%, p = 0.075), and multivariate analysis identified an age ≥ 80 years (OR 4.45, 95% CI 1.12-17.61, p = 0.033), multi-lobar pneumonia (OR 4.34, 95% CI 1.56-12.07, p = 0.005), and central nervous system disease (OR 3.63, 95% CI 1.08-12.20, p = 0.036) as independent risk factors for 30-day mortality. The rate of pneumococcal vaccination in the at-risk population was low (9.3%), but in the pandemic period the rate increased by 26.7%, driven by the anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign.
The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the epidemiology and clinical severity of SPB. In our study, less than 10% of the high-risk population was vaccinated, while the older population (age ≥ 80 years) had a significantly higher 30-day mortality risk. It would be necessary for Institutions to increase awareness campaigns for pneumococcal vaccination.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-15">摘要</h3>
<p>Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), also known as Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), is the etiological agent of Kaposi’s Sarcoma (KS) and other lymphoproliferative disorders. Over three decades after its discovery, many aspects of its biology, latency, immune evasion, and oncogenic mechanisms remain poorly understood. This review provides an integrative and up-to-date analysis of KSHV, from its molecular architecture and gene regulation to its complex host interactions and transmission dynamics. We highlight key viral proteins-LANA, RTA, vFLIP, vCyc, kaposins, and viral miRNAs-that orchestrate latency maintenance, lytic reactivation, immune modulation, and tumor development. The review maps how KSHV establishes persistent infection, exploits host signaling pathways, and induces hallmarks of cancer, such as angiogenesis and uncontrolled proliferation. We also discuss glycoprotein-receptor interactions involved in viral entry and the structural mechanisms facilitating KSHV-cell fusion. Clinically, we present updated epidemiological data and analyze the diversity of KS forms-classic, endemic, iatrogenic, epidemic, and anaplastic-highlighting regional disparities, diagnostic challenges, and treatment gaps. The article emphasizes the virus’s role in aggressive neoplasms in immunocompromised individuals and underscores the lack of antiviral strategies specifically targeting KSHV. By combining molecular virology, oncogenesis, immunology, and epidemiology, this review advances the current understanding of KSHV and reinforces the urgent need for effective diagnostic tools, preventive strategies, and targeted therapies. Our findings contribute to bridging knowledge gaps and promoting translational approaches to mitigate the global impact of KSHV-related diseases.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-16">摘要</h3>
<p>Stone disease amongst kidney transplant recipients (KTR) may not only lead to significant morbidity but also compromise graft function. In this context, percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) has emerged as a fundamental minimally invasive surgical technique for the treatment of kidney stones in KTR. The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of PCNL in KTR in a nationwide series, encompassing operative results, stone-free rate (SFR), stone composition and renal graft function.
Retrospective data from five Spanish tertiary hospitals was analysed. All KTR that underwent PCNL between January 2005 and August 2024 were included in the study. Stone characteristics, postoperative complications, and surgical outcomes were evaluated.
The study included 39 KTR, median age 59 (32-82) years, predominantly male (71.8%). Most KTR received grafts from cadaveric donors (n = 35). Even though stone diagnosis was often incidental (64.1%), 74.3% of KTR experienced stone-related events before surgery, such as acute kidney failure (53.8%) and sepsis (15.4%). Diagnosis occurred after a median of 53 (0-264) months post-transplant. Preoperative nephrostomy insertion was common (59.0%), and 48.7% of KTR had positive urine cultures. Median stone size was 14 (5-50) mm with 53.8% of KTR having multiple stones. Median stone density was 720 (130-1770) HU. Overall complication rate after PCNL was 10.2%: 2 patients presented with urinary septic shock, 1 patient experienced puncture site bleeding requiring embolization and 1 haematuria accompanied by acute renal failure. Stone-free rate was 82.0% in the first procedure, with secondary treatments being successful when needed. The most frequent stone composition was calcium oxalate monohydrate (55.2%).
In our experience, PCNL is an effective and safe technique for addressing nephrolithiasis in KTR. SFR and complication rates may be comparable to those reported in PCNL performed in native kidneys. Furthermore, patients tend to benefit from surgical care in high-volume centres that possess dedicated expertise in both KT and endourology.</p>

<p>It is increasingly evident that climate change has an inevitable impact on the environment, the society, and human health. NASA’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory has been measuring global carbon dioxide concentration such as XCO2 for years, and such remote sensing data have been proved to be effective in policy-making and implementation towards sustainable development. China’s “30-60” target has set a higher target for sustainable development. An 8-year retrospective sequential trend And a 4-year monthly forecast for Changzhou City in China using an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model are studied. Social and economic factors are incorporated into mathematical model for deriving carbon emissions from atmospheric CO2 concentration. Regional total net carbon emissions in all counties in Changzhou have been increasing over the past 8 years and during the COVID-19 pandemic, from 35.25 Mt in 2015 to 68.31 Mt in 2022, And are predicted to reach 93.26 Mt by 2026, while the growth rate will decrease from peak 13.65% to 7.69%. Carbon reduction measurements and technologies towards the carbon peak and carbon neutral have contributed to the decrease of carbon emission growth rate.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-18">摘要</h3>
<p>Chronic kidney disease of unknown origin (CKDu) primarily affects tropical agricultural countries. Renal deposition of calcium nanocrystals and nanotubes causes it. Thus, it was renamed crystal tubular nephropathy (CKD-CTN). CKD-CTN remains a major public health crisis in Sri Lanka’s dry-zone farming regions and other equatorial countries, especially Central America, with severe social and economic consequences.
We searched public databases since 2000 using keywords to identify relevant articles. The data were systematically compiled and synthesized into a narrative review, integrating recent findings to elucidate the most likely factors contributing to the onset of CKD-CTN.
Recent studies ruled out previously claimed agrochemicals, heavy metals, arsenic, and other nephrotoxins, as well as heat stress as causes. In contrast, evidence points to prolonged consumption of naturally contaminated groundwater as the primary cause. For the disease to manifest, however requires behavioral factors, such as chronic sustained dehydration, routine alcohol use, poverty-related malnutrition, etc. Together, these create sustained dehydration-ideal conditions for calcium crystal precipitation in renal tissues-a slow process, which gradually grow in the presence of fluoride into stable crystals, damaging kidneys and leading to CKD-CTN.
The review examines the current understanding of CKD-CTN, highlighting key environmental, biological, social, and occupational constrains and factors. It calls for a national strategy-public education, health interventions, environmental monitoring, nutritional support, policy reforms, and-most critically-universal access to affordable potable water. It stresses the urgency of sustainable water management, education, and stronger rural healthcare systems to mitigate this deadly disease AND its impact. The authors offer practical guidance for future research, interventions, and policies to prevent the burden of CKD-CTN on communities.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-19">摘要</h3>
<p>SPARC-Europe, the Stakeholder Political Alliance for Radioligand Cancer Therapies, was launched in October 2020. It represents an ambitious and collaborative initiative aimed at improving outcomes for cancer patients across Europe by advancing the policy and infrastructure needed to institutionalize Radioligand Therapies (RLTs). The current steering committee comprises several types of health care professionals, such as nuclear medicine specialists, clinicians, nurses, physicists, radio-pharmacists, and patient advocates, under a shared vision. Since its inception, SPARC-Europe has achieved several notable milestones, including the publication of a high-level position paper on improving access to RLTs., the production of an investment pathway document to guide infrastructure development, the recording of compelling patient testimony videos to humanize the need for expanded access, the organization of two influential policy events dedicated to RLTs, the support of motions for resolutions in the European Parliament that call for investments in radionuclide supply and hospital infrastructure. SPARC-Europe is continuing to deepen its work through targeted research and pilot programs, including the RADAR (Radioligand Awareness Research), a global survey focused on neuroendocrine neoplasms and prostate cancer to assess awareness, accessibility, and perceptions of RLTs among patients and physicians. By bringing together policy, science, and patient advocacy, SPARC-Europe is not only supporting innovation but actively shaping the frameworks needed to deliver it to those who need it most. As the European health landscape continues to evolve, SPARC-Europe offers a model for how patient-centered, evidence-based, and policy-savvy coalitions can drive meaningful change.</p>

<p>Liverpool, a city with an industrial legacy and among the most socioeconomically deprived local authorities in the UK, faces a significant health challenge: the combined impact of air pollution and deprivation on children’s respiratory health. This study deploys a dense network of 52 air quality sensors, one of the most comprehensive in the UK, to monitor particulate matter in 2023. PM2.5 levels ranged from 4.78 to 18.15 µg/m3 (median 7.15 µg/m3), and PM10 from 11.21 to 43.14 µg/m3 (median 17.30 µg/m3), frequently exceeding WHO thresholds. High concentrations were found in northern wards with high deprivation. Hospital admission rates for under-18 s ranged from 0.2 to 2%, exceeding national averages. Linear regression showed Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) scores explained 16.1% of the variance in hospital admissions (R2 = 0.1608, β = 0.023 to 0.025, p &lt; 0.02), more than PM2.5 (6.6%) or PM10 (4.7%). Interaction terms suggested amplified pollution effects in deprived areas. Liverpool offers a valuable case study for understanding the intersection of environmental and social determinants of health as seen in many urban UK settings. Socioeconomic deprivation emerged as both a mediator, through factors like healthcare access, and a confounder in the pollution-health relationship. These findings underscore the need for targeted emission reductions and investment in disadvantaged communities. Future research with extended data could confirm these patterns and support broader policy action.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-21">摘要</h3>
<p>The Joint Action project on Cancer and other Non-communicable Diseases (NCDs) prevention, Action on Health Determinants, includes a dedicated workstream on structural and population-level interventions. The overarching objective of this workstream is to strengthen the compliance, coherence, implementation and enforcement of evidence-based regulatory measures that support governmental efforts to reduce the burden of NCDs.
The workstream adopts a multi-method approach, informed by existing academic literature and previous European studies. Key methodologies include policy mapping, evidence reviews, behavioural assessments, policy impact modelling, and pilot testing. Governmental alcohol and tobacco policies will be evaluated using comparative policy scales, while the health and economic impacts of health taxation policies will be projected through and microsimulation modelling. Nutrient profile modelling and food composition databases will be developed to inform strategies for food reformulation. The effectiveness of labelling interventions will be examined. Tools for monitoring digital marketing exposure will be developed, and the impact of environmental policy impact will be assessed.
The workstream is expected to deliver comprehensive policy analyses, demonstrate the potential impact of health taxation, propose harmonized nutrient profiling frameworks, assess the effectiveness of food and alcohol labelling practices and contribute to the development of cross-national structures for public food procurement. Additionally, it will provide guidance on the implementation of effective measures and evaluate divergences in national policy approaches across Europe.
The workstream will generate actionable evidence and documentation to inform and support public policy processes, thereby contributing to reductions in the burden of preventable disease across the region.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-22">摘要</h3>
<p>Understanding characteristics of capital investment among community hospitals at the national level has been somewhat limited in the recent literature. The present study aimed to describe characteristics of hospital capital investment and its association with financial and organizational characteristics. This cross-sectional study utilized a secondary data analysis with the American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey data from 2018 to 2020 (n = 7,492). We performed descriptive and inferential statistics. Multivariate regression was conducted to identify specific financial and organizational factors associated with hospital capital spending. Results of regression analyses shows that no financial factors were associated while select organizational factors were associated with capital spending. Specifically, capital spending was positively associated with urban hospitals, quality of care (e.g., the Joint Commission accreditation), teaching hospitals, while capital expenses were reversely associated with Medicare certified hospitals, ownership of separate nursing homes, and for-profit entities, and older facilities. It is unclear why those value-based payment models such as ACOs and value-based incentives were not associated with capital spending. This warrants further research efforts. In our study, only select organizational factors were associated with capital spending. Policy makers and hospital executives may want to consider evaluating which organizational factors would be positively or reversely linked to capital spending as they seek to maintain and modernize their physical facilities and hospital operations.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-23">摘要</h3>
<p>HIV criminalisation is a global phenomenon undermining both public health and human rights. Although scientific advances have transformed HIV into a manageable condition, legal systems have not kept pace. This paper traces the evolution of community-led responses to HIV criminalisation over nearly two decades, demonstrating how science, advocacy, and storytelling have collectively reshaped legal and policy frameworks. It describes the formation and strategic interventions of the HIV Justice Network and, later, the HIV JUSTICE WORLDWIDE coalition; highlights methodological innovations such as legal monitoring and community-based documentation; and emphasises the centrality of human rights principles. Case examples - including the legacy of Ugandan nurse Rosemary Namubiru - illustrate the impact of HIV criminalisation and the power of resilience. While challenges persist amidst growing authoritarianism and disinformation, coordinated global efforts continue to advance evidence-informed, rights-based alternatives. This paper calls for a humanisation of the law that centres lived experiences, elevates scientific understanding, and fosters justice for people living with HIV. Ultimately, this paper argues for a paradigm shift from punitive legal responses to approaches rooted in care, dignity, and justice.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-24">摘要</h3>
<p>This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of yoga interventions in individuals with intellectual disabilities (ID), a population vulnerable to physical and mental health issues and in need of accessible, holistic therapies.
Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search was conducted in Web of Science, PubMed, SPORTDiscus, and Scopus up to March 2025. Study quality was assessed using PEDro and MINORS tools.
Ten studies involving 518 participants met inclusion criteria. Yoga interventions (ranging from five weeks to 10 months) showed significant within-group improvements in balance, anthropometric measures, pulmonary and cardiovascular parameters. Between-group differences favored yoga over no intervention, although benefits were often comparable to other exercise modalities. Methodological quality was mostly “good” for RCTs, but lower for comparative studies.
Yoga appears to be a promising strategy for improving balance, anthropometric parameters, and pulmonary function in individuals with ID.
Yoga can be integrated as a complementary strategy within intervention programs for individuals with intellectual disabilities, particularly when the goal is to improve balance, anthropometric parameters, and pulmonary function.Rehabilitation professionals may prescribe structured yoga programs lasting at least five weeks, with three or more sessions per week of 45–60 min, as a feasible and safe option.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-25">摘要</h3>
<p>Antimicrobial resistance is a growing global health threat that disproportionately affects socially and economically disadvantaged populations. National Action Plans are critical for coordinating national responses, but the extent to which they address equity remains unclear. This study assessed how antimicrobial resistance National Action Plans from 14 West African countries incorporate equity considerations.
We reviewed antimicrobial resistance National Action Plans from 14 West African countries using a four-domain equity framework: (1) recognition of equity, (2) identification of vulnerable populations, (3) inclusion of equity-oriented interventions and (4) integration of equity into governance and monitoring. We assessed whether National Action Plans acknowledged 16 high-risk groups, including people living with HIV, displaced or mobile populations, children and adolescents, older adults, people with mental health disorders, rural residents, people with chronic illnesses, people living with disabilities, pregnant women, low-income populations, healthcare workers, people with substance use disorders, incarcerated populations, indigenous or minority groups, homeless populations and migrants or seasonal workers.
All National Action Plans adopted a One Health approach, but equity was inconsistently addressed. Most did not explicitly reference equity, and none included equity-related indicators in monitoring frameworks. Healthcare workers and rural populations were the most frequently mentioned groups. Common interventions included hygiene promotion, public awareness campaigns and training of healthcare workers, but these were largely generic and rarely adapted to the specific needs of marginalised populations. Stakeholder engagement was often multisectoral but seldom ensured the participation of disadvantaged groups. Across the region, the lack of disaggregated data and tailored strategies highlights a significant equity gap.
Equity remains insufficiently integrated into antimicrobial resistance governance in West Africa. Future National Action Plans must explicitly identify at-risk populations, include equity indicators and involve affected communities in planning and oversight. Embedding equity is essential to building resilient and people-centred antimicrobial resistance strategies.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-26">摘要</h3>
<p>This study investigated the association between lifestyle habits and the risk of depression among people living with someone needing care in Japan.
Data were collected from those who participated in the Yamagata Cohort Study; 11 019 participants aged 40 and above were considered. The primary endpoints were living with someone in need of care and depression risk, and individual factors related to these endpoints were examined. Unadjusted and multifactor-adjusted logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the association between the risk of depression and personal factors among those living with someone needing care.
Of the participants, 942 (8.5%) were living with someone who needed care. The proportion of participants who were at risk for depression was significantly higher among those living with someone needing care; this group also had significantly higher odds ratios than those at low risk of depression for the following factors: economic comfort: hardship; sleep duration: more than 9 h; getting enough sleep, including nights and naps: not enough; go out at least once a week: no; and walking or equivalent physical activity in daily life for at least 1 h a day: no.
To reduce the risk of depression among family caregivers, providing them with appropriate social and financial support is crucial. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2025; ••: ••-••.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-27">摘要</h3>
<p>To evaluate the impact of low-dose aspirin (LDA) on placental size and uterine artery pulsatility index (UtA-PI) by analyzing longitudinal changes between the first and second trimesters in pregnancies at high risk for early-onset pre-eclampsia (PE).
This was a prospective observational cohort study of 631 singleton pregnancies. Women at high risk of early-onset PE (delivery ≤ 33 + 6 weeks) were identified using maternal factors or a multivariate screening protocol and were prescribed LDA. Placental size was assessed using two- and three-dimensional ultrasonography, and UtA-PI was measured using transabdominal Doppler, with measurements obtained in the first and second trimesters. Differences in placental measurements and UtA-PI between high-risk women receiving LDA and low-risk untreated women were analyzed.
Among the 631 participants, 53 (8.4%) women were prescribed LDA for the prevention of early-onset PE. Placental size in the first trimester was significantly smaller in the LDA group compared with the untreated group, as exemplified by placental volume (mean ± SD, 68.46 ± 25.19 cm3 vs 76.31 ± 23.63 cm3; P = 0.022), and this trend persisted into the second trimester. However, no significant differences in placental growth from the first to the second trimester were observed between the groups. UtA-PI was significantly higher in the LDA group in both trimesters, but a greater decrease in UtA-PI multiples of the median values between trimesters was noted in these women (mean ± SD, -14.0 ± 0.28% vs -4.5 ± 0.31%; P = 0.021). Perinatal outcomes were similar between the groups, with the exception of a higher rate of Cesarean delivery in the LDA group (38.5% vs 21.1%; P = 0.008).
Women at high risk for early-onset PE have a smaller placenta and higher UtA-PI in the first and second trimesters. Treatment of high-risk women with LDA did not affect placental growth but was associated with a greater reduction in UtA-PI, suggesting a positive effect of LDA on placental perfusion. These findings provide insight into the mechanism of action of LDA in the prevention of PE. © 2025 The Author(s).

<h3 id="摘要-28">摘要</h3>
<p>BACKGROUND EBV-associated smooth muscle tumors (EBV-SMTs) are rare malignancies in pediatric transplant recipients under chronic immunosuppression, with fewer than100 cases reported globally. Diagnosis is challenging due to nonspecific imaging findings and overlapping features with other post-transplant malignancies, necessitating histopathological confirmation. This underscores the need for heightened clinical suspicion in high-risk cohorts. CASE REPORT Here, we present a pediatric case from our liver transplant (LT) center involving a patient who developed both post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) and EBV-SMT following liver transplantation. Clinical data and comprehensive treatment details of this rare case were retrospectively reviewed. The patient, diagnosed with a congenital bile acid synthesis defect, underwent liver transplantation at the age of 5 months. Pre-transplant screening confirmed that both the donor and recipient were negative for cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infections. However, EBV DNA became detectable in peripheral blood at 22.5 months after transplantation and showed a progressive increase over time. At 30.9 months after LT, PTLD and hepatic EBV-SMT were simultaneously diagnosed through histopathological examination. Treatment strategies included stepwise immunosuppression reduction, administration of rituximab targeting PTLD, and subsequent sirolimus therapy for EBV-SMT and surgical resection of the liver and splenic tumor. This multidisciplinary approach successfully achieved complete remission. CONCLUSIONS EBV-SMT necessitates multidisciplinary management balancing immunosuppression with targeted therapies. mTOR inhibitors are a strategic option for concurrent rejection prevention and tumor control. Sirolimus, a mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, demonstrates promise by simultaneously preventing rejection and inhibiting tumor progression.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-29">摘要</h3>
<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterised by dopaminergic (DA) neuron loss and the formation of Lewy bodies composed of aggregated α-synuclein (α-Syn) in the substantia nigra (SN). Emerging evidence suggests that PD may originate in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, where α-Syn aggregates in enteroendocrine cells that synapse with vagal afferents, facilitating disease spread to the central nervous system. Using electrophysiological, behavioural, molecular, and immunohistochemical methods, we examined the effects of capsaicin-induced degeneration of vagal afferents on PD progression in models: one was prepared by injecting α-Syn preformed fibrils into the GI tract, and the other was prepared by orally administering rotenone. The results showed that vagal afferents mediate GI sensory signals affecting DA and GABA neurons in the SN. Vagal afferent degeneration reduces α-Syn accumulation in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and SN while improving motor impairments, highlighting their role in α-Syn transmission and PD pathogenesis.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-30">摘要</h3>
<p>As one of the most complex diseases, breast cancer (BC) is a leading cause of death among women globally, and various species of probiotics may offer benefits in managing BC treatment. While previous studies have examined the impact of potent probiotics concerning BC and its associated risk factors, particularly Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, it is essential to note that these effects are strain-specific. Research on the specific effects of different Lactobacillus strains in preventing or alleviating BC complications is limited, even though Lactobacillus has been extensively studied, especially in vitro and in vivo. In this regard, oral administration of Lactobacillus strains, including Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus), Lacticaseibacillus casei (L. casei), Lacticaseibacillus helveticus (L. helveticus), Ligilactobacillus lactis (L. lactis), and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (L. plantarum), significantly promotes immune responses and anti-cancer properties against BC. In addition, oral capsule supplements containing several Lactobacillus strains, such as Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus (L. rhamnosus) and L. acidophilus, combined with Bifidobacteria or prebiotics (a synbiotic), have been clinically proven to be effective. Moreover, some anti-carcinogenic mechanisms of Lactobacillus strains may appear more prominent than others, which contribute to alleviating cancer complications. These include interactions with the gut microbiota, modulation of the immune system, induction of apoptosis, anti-inflammatory effects, the impact of probiotic-derived agents, and epigenetic regulation. This paper reviews the pathways related to Lactobacillus strains to understand their unique impacts on BC better and explores the potential mechanisms involved. Given the possible diversity of effects among different Lactobacillus strains, future research should focus on specific strains.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-31">摘要</h3>
<p>Lead exposure is a significant factor in the development of chronic kidney disease. This study examined the effects of the monoterpene eucalyptol on nephrotoxicity induced by lead acetate in adult male Wistar rats. The animals were divided into four groups: Control, Eucalyptol, Lead, and Lead-Eucalyptol. Over 14 days, lead acetate (25 mg/kg) and eucalyptol (100 mg/kg) were administered via gavage. The results showed that eucalyptol reduced the levels of malondialdehyde in the kidneys of rats exposed to lead acetate (p &lt; 0.05). It also increased levels of glutathione (p &lt; 0.05) and enhanced the activities of the enzymes superoxide dismutase (p &lt; 0.05) and glutathione peroxidase (p &lt; 0.01). Likewise, eucalyptol reduced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α (p &lt; 0.01), interleukin (IL)-1 beta (p &lt; 0.001), and IL-6 (p &lt; 0.001) as well as Bax (p &lt; 0.001) and caspase-3 (p &lt; 0.001), while increasing the expression of Bcl2 (p &lt; 0.01). It elevated the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) (p &lt; 0.001), thereby preventing histopathological damage. Moreover, treatment with eucalyptol resulted in a reduction in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels in rats exposed to lead acetate (p &lt; 0.001). We concluded that eucalyptol mitigates lead-induced nephrotoxicity by inhibiting oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. The renoprotective effects of eucalyptol appear to be mediated by the stimulation of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. Therefore, eucalyptol may represent a promising option for reducing lead-induced toxicity.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-32">摘要</h3>
<p>This research aimed to explore the positive impacts of Ocimum sanctum on Oreochromis niloticus against waterborne cadmium (Cd) toxicity. Total 180 fish (18.41 ± 0.11 g/fish) were distributed into six experimental groups, with three replicates per group, across 18 experimental tanks. Cadmium chloride (CdCl2) was used at a concentration of 3 µg/L. Six treatment groups were: the negative control group, without any supplement or Cd exposure; the positive control group, which received no supplements but exposed to Cd; third group with 10 g/kg supplementation along with Cd 3 µg/L exposure; fourth group with 20 g/kg supplementation along with Cd 3 µg/L exposure; fifth group with 30 g/kg supplementation along with Cd 3 µg/L exposure; and sixth group with 40 g/kg supplementation along with Cd 3 µg/L exposure. The trial lasted for sixty days. Results revealed that waterborne Cd exposure adversely affect the fish growth, body composition, and hematological parameters. However, incorporating O. sanctum considerably increased fish survival and reduced the harmful impacts of Cd. Notably, supplementation at a rate of 30 g/kg improved growth, enhanced carcass quality, and restored blood indices. Ultimately, the results showed that heavy metal toxicity could be successfully mitigated in O. niloticus aquaculture by adding 30 g/kg of O. sanctum as a nutritional supplement. The present findings suggest that the potent bioactive compounds like eugenol and urosolic acid, exhibit antimicrobial, antioxidant, stress-reducing immunostimulant, and hepatoprotective properties in O. sanctum which improve growth, body composition, and hematological parameters while mitigating the effects of Cd toxicity in O. niloticus.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-33">摘要</h3>
<p>Microplastics (MPs) are increasingly recognized as stressors in agricultural soils, yet the consequences of aging remain poorly understood. Here, we evaluated the effects of pristine and aged polyethylene (PE) and polystyrene (PS) MPs on Brassica chinensis and soil function in a 45-day pot experiment. MPs were artificially aged by photo-oxidation and incubation before application at 0.1 and 1% (w/w). Compared with pristine MPs, aged MPs with oxidized surfaces induced stronger toxicity, reducing plant height (-24.1%) and biomass (-34.3%), lowering chlorophyll content, and elevating oxidative stress markers (malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px)). Metabolomic analysis indicated disruptions in carbohydrate, amino acid, and energy metabolism. In parallel, soil phosphatase and amylase activities as well as total nitrogen were significantly suppressed, with aged PE also impairing Zn uptake. These findings demonstrate that aging amplifies MPs’ phytotoxicity and soil dysfunction, underscoring their heightened ecological risk in agroecosystems.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-34">摘要</h3>
<p>Parents of children with autism are exposed to stressors associated with the daily care of raising a child with a developmental disability, which may negatively impact parental quality of life (QOL). The specific aim of this study was to examine the relationships between demographic factors, stress, and coping among parental caregivers of children with autism to determine whether predictors of QOL exist.
This study was descriptive, and an electronic survey was distributed to parents of children, age 3-21 years old, diagnosed with autism. The survey measured parent-reported demographic factors, severity of the child’s diagnosis of autism, parental stress, coping, and QOL. Data were analyzed using multiple regression.
Study findings suggest that, in parental caregivers of children with autism in (N = 152) daily stressors, coping self-efficacy, and household income were predictors for physical QOL; daily stressors and coping self-efficacy were predictors of psychological QOL, and coping-self efficacy, household income, and severity of the diagnosis of the child were predictors for environmental QOL.
Coping self-efficacy and improved income can positively improve QOL, while severity of the diagnosis of autism and daily stressors can negatively impact QOL. Clinically, nurses with a better understanding of the parental stress and coping in parents of children with autism can better recommend tailored resources to improve QOL. Policies to support financial help for families may also improve QOL. Future research should focus on interventions to support caregiver health.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-35">摘要</h3>
<p>Autistic children have been shown to have poorer bone health than their non-autistic peers, but previous evidence on this topic has been based on small clinical samples and is limited by how bone health has been measured. The association between autism and bone health may also reflect confounding by correlated genetic or environmental factors, but prior studies have not addressed this issue.
We address these issues using data from a population-representative cohort of Australian children with bone health measured by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) for both children and parents. Data for 1,274 children (66 autistic, 1,208 non-autistic) aged 11-12 years (50% male) were drawn from the Child Health CheckPoint within the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children. pQCT measures at the tibial diaphysis (ankle) and metaphysis (shin) were recorded using an identical protocol for children and one attending parent. Child autism was parent reported. Regression analyses were used to compare differences between autistic and non-autistic children, and between parents of autistic children and parents of non-autistic children.
Our findings indicate poorer bone health as assessed by tibial pQCT among autistic children compared to non-autistic children at both the metaphysis and diaphysis. No differences in pQCT measures were found between parents of autistic and non-autistic children, suggesting no evidence of confounding by shared genetic or environmental factors.
These findings reinforce the need to support improved bone development among autistic children and suggest that differences in bone health are likely driven by behavioural factors that are potentially amenable to intervention.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-36">摘要</h3>
<p>Predicting perioperative complications in high-risk elderly patients with lung cancer has become increasingly important as the population ages. This study investigated the relationship between preoperative diaphragmatic thickness (DT) and perioperative complications.
We enrolled 101 patients ≥ 75 years old who had undergone radical resection for primary lung cancer between 2013 and 2018. Bilateral DT was measured on axial and coronal computed tomography, and the mean DT (MDT) was calculated based on these measurements. Outcomes were assessed based on postoperative complications, defined as Clavien-Dindo classification ≥ 2.
The MDT was 3.51 ± 1.00 mm. Thirteen patients who experienced postoperative respiratory complications had a significantly lower MDT than a higher MDT (p = 0.0390). Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that an MDT ≤ 3.63 mm was an independent factor associated with postoperative complications (odds ratio, 5.559).
Patients with a low MDT are at an increased risk of postoperative complications. Therefore, these patients require careful perioperative management.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-37">摘要</h3>
<p>After vision, hearing is the most important sensory mechanism for obtaining essential and critical information during flight operations. Pilots are at risk of hearing loss due to exposure to excessive noise which usually causes permanent and incurable hearing damage. This study investigated the hearing status of Iranian pilots and explored the relationship between the severity of their impairment, age, work experience and flight hours.
In this cross-sectional study, eligible pilots were selected. Demographic information, job characteristics, flight hours and auditory complaints were collected. Subsequently, the pilots underwent hearing tests (Pure tone Audiometry) and the hearing threshold was measured at different frequencies.
the study involved 100 pilots (57 fixed-wing pilots and 43 helicopter pilots) with the mean age of 47.77 ± 7.53 years (28-64 years). The average and standard deviation of work experience in all the studied subjects was equal to 24.84 ± 8.44 years. 55 pilots had no auditory impairments, while 45 were diagnosed with some form of hearing impairment. The findings indicate that older age, longer work experience, and more flight hours are significantly associated with greater hearing impairments. Individuals with any level of hearing impairment (slight to mild) had higher age, more work experience, and flight hours compared to those with normal hearing. Helicopter pilots exhibited higher hearing loss severity across frequencies compared to fixed-wing pilots, with statistically significant differences at 2000 Hz for the left ear and 1000, 2000, and 3000 Hz for the right ear. The comparison between the two ears showed that the hearing threshold in any of the flight devices (fixed wing or helicopter), in any of the investigated frequencies, has no significant difference between the left and right ears.
Exposure to loud noise during flights can significantly impact the hearing of pilots. The severity of hearing loss in helicopter pilots is higher across all frequencies compared to fixed-wing pilots. Increased age, work experience, and flight hours are significantly associated with higher severity of hearing loss in both ears. Regular auditory assessments for pilots, especially helicopter pilots, are essential for early detection and monitoring of noise-induced hearing loss.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-38">摘要</h3>
<p>Stroke causes diminished occupational participation from the acute phase, considerably impacting quality of life. We aimed to explore the experiences of diminished occupational participation among acute stroke survivors. We conducted a qualitative thematic analysis on interviews with 12 participants within 3 wk post-onset. Results identified four themes: (1) being at the mercy of uncertain physical recovery, (2) resistance to role loss, (3) disconnection from daily life, and (4) awareness of supporters. This study offers new insights for developing a rehabilitation approach that integrates an occupational perspective from the acute phase. It is important to addresses not only physical recovery, but also prioritize the restoration of meaningful occupational engagement, personal identity reconstruction, and continuity in daily life disrupted by stroke by closely monitoring their fluctuating emotions and promoting awareness of supporters may be effective strategies for client-centred occupational therapy in the acute phase.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-39">摘要</h3>
<p>Multiciliated cells (MCCs) bear numerous motile cilia that drive fluid flow, but how numerous centrioles for multiciliation are generated has remained unresolved. Here, we report that the “master” MCC transcriptional regulator, MCIDAS, moonlights in the cytoplasm to organize massive centriole biogenesis. Like MCIDAS, its co-transcriptional factors, E2F4 and E2F5, also undergo cytoplasmic accumulation, colocalizing with MCIDAS and forming procentrioles. MCIDAS loss inhibited E2F4/5 cytoplasmic accumulation and blocked centriole assembly. Furthermore, we show that the cytoplasmic accumulation of MCIDAS is mediated by CRM1-dependant nuclear export, and its inhibition specifically compromised centriole biogenesis. By contrast, on loss of parental centrioles and deuterosomes, which does not impair centriole formation, E2F4 cytoplasmic localization remained unaffected, establishing that the MCIDAS-E2F4/5 cytoplasmic complex represents the de novo centriole biogenesis pathway. We have also assembled a comprehensive list of MCIDAS targets, a resource which will enable further exposition of MCC biology and pathological mechanisms of motile ciliopathies.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-40">摘要</h3>
<p>Mucormycosis is a rare but life‑threatening fungal infection that has shown an increased incidence in Brazil, especially during the COVID‑19 pandemic.
To provide an evidence‑based, context‑specific guideline for the diagnosis and management of mucormycosis within the Brazilian healthcare system.
Rhino‑orbito‑cerebral disease predominates, followed by pulmonary, cutaneous, gastrointestinal and disseminated forms; delayed recognition dramatically increases mortality.
The global incidence of mucormycosis is increasing, particularly among patients with diabetes mellitus, hematologic malignancies, transplantation, and corticosteroid exposure. The most frequently isolated species is Rhizopus arrhizus, and regional variations in species distribution may be present. In Brazil, comprehensive epidemiological data remain scarce.
Early, aggressive surgical debridement plus induction with liposomal amphotericin B (5-10 mg/kg/day) followed by isavuconazole or posaconazole is recommended; strict control of hyperglycemia and immunosuppression is essential.
Standardized national guidance, improved rapid diagnostics, systematic surveillance and equitable drug availability are critical to reduce Brazil’s mucormycosis burden.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-41">摘要</h3>
<p>Widespread social media use presents an opportunity for health promotion among adolescents with chronic health conditions (CHCs), but rapid changes in technology preferences and affordances pose a challenge for researchers whose work progresses more slowly. The purpose of this systematic scoping review is to describe the size, range, and characteristics of contemporary research efforts (between 2018 and 2024) to investigate social media interventions for adolescents with CHCs. We searched six databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CINAHL, and ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses Global) and sought additional grey literature. Inclusion criteria were studies designing, user-testing, evaluating, or otherwise investigating social media interventions for adolescents with CHCs. Two independent reviewers screened abstracts, assessed full-text articles, and extracted variables using Covidence. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses-Scoping guidelines. Twenty-five research projects met the inclusion criteria. The most common theories/frameworks were social cognitive theory, cognitive behavioral theory, social support theories, design theories, and participatory frameworks. The interventions all targeted single diagnoses (most often type 1 diabetes and human immunodeficiency virus). The predominant intervention strategy was to facilitate education, peer support, and discussion within text-based online communities. The most popular contemporary platforms and short-form videos were underutilized. Outcomes included variables related to the youth’s intervention experience (e.g., usability, engagement); internal, proximal variables (e.g., self-efficacy, stigma); relational, proximal variables (e.g., social support, connection to the clinic); health behaviors (e.g., treatment adherence, transition readiness); and overall impacts on health and well-being (e.g., health status indicators, quality of life). Although theoretical frameworks, methods, and outcomes were wide-ranging, the specific intervention strategies were more limited in variety. Future research efforts should investigate whether embedding interventions in social media platforms youth use in their everyday lives and integrating public health and implementation science methods result in greater engagement or improved outcomes.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-42">摘要</h3>
<p>Treatment of pediatric B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) impacts both patients and their caregivers. An understanding of family functioning during therapy can inform family-centered care. We aimed to prospectively identify negative and positive changes in family life as perceived by caregivers throughout ALL therapy.
Caregivers of children aged ≥4 years with average-risk B-ALL enrolled on the Children’s Oncology Group trial AALL0932 who consented to an ancillary study were asked: “How has family life changed since your child’s diagnosis of leukemia for the better or for the worse?” Written free responses were collected at approximately 2, 8, 17, 26 (end of therapy for females), and 38 (end of therapy for males) months post-diagnosis. Inductive content analysis was used to create codes, subcategories, and categories. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample and frequencies of reported codes.
Overall, 994 responses were collected from caregivers of 468 children across all timepoints. Twenty-seven individual codes were identified, categorized by negative changes (reported by 89% of caregivers) and positive changes (reported by 58% of caregivers). Subcategories of negative changes, including changes in daily routines, work and finance, patient health and care needs, effects on other family members, and emotional changes, were identified across all timepoints, but were most prevalent early in therapy. Importantly, positive changes were also identified, including family support, community support, and changes in outlook.
This study identifies negative and positive family changes perceived by caregivers of children undergoing B-ALL therapy that can inform future interventions to better support families.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-43">摘要</h3>
<p>Recent shifts in public policy and legislation have aimed to dismantle progress toward racial equity in the United States, especially within the realm of education. Dental education institutions are responsible for cultivating the oral healthcare workforce of the future, but their ability to meet the growing dental burden is hampered by the intentional dismantling of equitable, race-conscious policies in education. This manuscript makes the case for dental school administrators and faculty to ethically promote racial equity and inclusion in their institutions and proposes strategies to accomplish this goal.
The authors synthesized existing evidence to support the promotion of anti-racist initiatives in oral health education and dental curricula. They proposed a three-pronged call to action detailing strategies that dental school administrators could rapidly implement to drive equity and higher-quality dental education and oral healthcare more broadly.
The authors strongly recommend that dental school administrators: 1) Intentionally frame a message of urgency regarding the promotion of racial equity in dental education, 2) Elevate student leaders to be the leading advocates for inclusivity in dental schools, and 3) Evaluate student applicants holistically using professional competencies, so the future dental workforce will feature professionals who uphold all the standards of the profession, not just academic standards.
The reversal of racially inclusive educational policies threatens to diminish the quality of dental education. With these proposed strategies and others, educators can improve dental schools nationally, and the future oral healthcare workforce can better serve all people.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-44">摘要</h3>
<p>Trisomy 13, the third most common autosomal trisomy after trisomy 21 and trisomy 18, is associated with a significantly high infant mortality rate. However, large-scale studies examining causes of death in trisomy 13 remain scarce. Therefore, we aimed to better understand the mortality patterns. To this end, a population-based study was conducted using Japanese population-based mortality data from the Vital Statistics Database (n = 4,230,092 death records); we examined early mortality and identified phenotypic subgroups based on combinations of co-occurring causes of death. We identified 150 individuals with trisomy 13 who died between 2019 and 2021. Cardiovascular disease was significantly associated with early mortality. Using K-means clustering based on principal components of cause-of-death categories, we identified three distinct subgroups: respiratory-dominant (19%), cardiovascular-dominant (64%), and multi-organ involvement (17%). The cardiovascular-dominant cluster showed the highest rate of death before age 1 (83%; p = 0.001), while surgical intervention rates did not significantly differ across clusters. These findings highlight phenotypic heterogeneity and may support individualized care planning for trisomy 13 and provide insights that may support future care and decision-making.</p>

<strong>链接</strong>: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40974630">PubMed</a></p>

<h3 id="摘要-45">摘要</h3>
<p>The study aimed to investigate the association between glyphosate (GLY) exposure, using urinary GLY and its primary metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), and the DNA damage biomarkers 8-hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and N7-methylguanine (N7-MeG) in rural populations in Taiwan.
A cross-sectional study was conducted with 368 participants from a rural area in Taiwan characterized by extensive agricultural activity. Urinary concentrations of GLY, AMPA, and the DNA damage biomarkers 8-OHdG and N7-MeG were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). GLY and AMPA concentrations were creatinine-adjusted (μg/g creatinine) and log2 transformed. Multivariable linear and logistic regression models were performed to evaluate the associations.
Urinary GLY and AMPA were positively associated with the oxidative stress biomarker 8-OHdG and the DNA methylation biomarker N7-MeG. In linear regression models adjusted for age, gender, and occupation, the geometric mean ratios (GMR) per doubling of GLY and AMPA were 1.11 (95 % CI: 1.04-1.19) and 1.19 (95 % CI: 1.10-1.30) for 8-OHdG, and 1.10 (95 % CI: 1.03-1.18) and 1.16 (95 % CI: 1.08-1.26) for N7-MeG, respectively. The adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were 1.79 (95 % CI: 1.39-2.31) and 1.69 (95 % CI: 1.30-2.19) for high 8-OHdG, and 1.55 (95 % CI: 1.23-1.95) and 1.74 (95 % CI: 1.33-2.28) for high N7-MeG, per doubling of GLY and AMPA concentrations.
These findings indicate that urinary GLY and AMPA concentrations are positively associated with 8-OHdG and N7-MeG, implicating carcinogenic pathways of oxidative stress and DNA methylation. The results highlight the need for further research and regulatory considerations, particularly in agricultural communities.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-46">摘要</h3>
<p>Programs redirecting patients with non-urgent presentations from Emergency Departments (EDs) to the community (ED2C), by providing them a booked community appointment in lieu of waiting for ED care, may reduce ED crowding. We sought to evaluate the department- and patient-level impact of an ED2C program in an urban tertiary pediatric ED.
We conducted a matched cross-sectional study to describe patients redirected by a pediatric ED2C program and determine if the program changed ED operations. Days with the program were matched on day type (weekday vs. weekend) and department volume (±10%) to days when ED patients were not being redirected. Measures of ED flow and utilization on days with and without the program were compared using t-tests and linear regression models.
Of the 6164 patients eligible for the ED2C program for 53 days that redirection was offered, 900 were redirected (14.6%). On average, 17.7 (SD 8.5) patients were redirected and 92.4 (SD 23.7) eligible patients were not redirected each day the ED2C was in operation. Patients who were redirected had a significantly shorter length of stay (LOS) than those who were eligible but not redirected (2.9 ± 2.0 h vs. 8.5 ± 4.3 h, p-value &lt; 0.0001). Three patients who were redirected (0.3%) and 11 eligible but not redirected (0.2%) returned to the ED and were hospitalized. Average median departmental LOS, time to physician assessment, daily proportion hospitalized patients, proportion of patients left without being seen, and ED return visits did not differ on days with and without the program.
A small proportion of eligible patients were redirected. These patients experienced a lower LOS, without increasing the proportion of return visits. ED operations were unchanged. Refining eligibility criteria for pediatric redirection with an emphasis on patient safety is necessary.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-48">摘要</h3>
<p>Children born preterm are at increased risk for cognitive difficulties. While gestational age is a known predictor, the combined influence of early-life variables such as breastfeeding, NICU stay, and birth weight on later cognitive outcomes remains less understood.
To compare cognitive performance between preterm and non preterm school-aged children and identify neonatal and postnatal predictors of verbal and non verbal intelligence.
A total of 140 children aged 6-12 years (70 preterm, 70 non preterm) were assessed using Raven’s Coloured Progressive Matrices (CPM) and Crichton Vocabulary Scale (CVS). Mann-Whitney U tests and multiple linear regressions were used to examine group differences and predictors of cognitive scores. Predictors included gestational age, NICU stay, socioeconomic status (SES), breastfeeding, birth weight, age, and sex. VIF values were used to assess multicollinearity.
Preterm children scored significantly lower than non preterm peers on both CPM (p &lt; 0.001, r = - 0.27) and CVS (p &lt; 0.001, r = - 0.43). Regression models showed that gestational age was a consistent predictor across both scales. Breastfeeding and higher SES were associated with higher CPM and CVS scores, while prolonged NICU stay negatively impacted CVS performance. No multicollinearity issues were detected (VIF &lt; 2.6).
Preterm birth is linked to reduced cognitive performance during middle childhood, especially in verbal reasoning. Breastfeeding and shorter NICU stay may offer protective benefits. These findings highlight the importance of early-life factors and support targeted developmental surveillance and interventions for preterm populations.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-49">摘要</h3>
<p>Accurate monitoring of pathogenic viruses in wastewater is critical for early outbreak and risk assessment. This study presented a novel biosensing platform that combined an interparticle magnetic covalent organic framework (MCOF)-assisted mismatched catalytic hairpin assembly (iMMCHA) with CRISPR/Cas12a-activated colorimetric-photothermal dual-mode detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The system strategically immobilized CHA reactants (H1 and mismatched H2) on separate MCOF nanoparticles, creating a spatially confined and collision-enhanced interparticle MCHA that achieved 270-fold higher local reactant concentration and 20-min faster kinetics than solution-phase CHA. Upon target recognition, the iMMCHA system generated dsDNA activators that triggered Cas12a-mediated cleavage of ssDNA linkers on magnetic bead-glucose oxidase conjugates. This cleavage event reduced the TMB-oxidizing activity of the magnetically isolated integrated enzyme system, producing inversely correlated colorimetric and photothermal signals. This iMMCHA-CRISPR dual-mode assay allowed for the rapid and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in sanitary wastewater samples, with detection limits of 100 and 120 copies/μL (colorimetric mode) and 100 and 140 copies/μL (photothermal mode) for S and N genes, respectively. This work established a powerful platform for aqueous environmental virus monitoring that combined the specificity of CRISPR with the signal enhancement and kinetics acceleration of nanoconfined interparticle CHA and the reliability of dual-mode detection.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-50">摘要</h3>
<p>Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer, notably lacks effective treatment strategies. Although androgen receptor (AR) has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for TNBC, monotherapy with AR inhibitors has proven to be of restricted efficacy. Aiming to develop superior therapeutic approaches, a comprehensive drug library screening was conducted. The ERK inhibitor GDC-0994 exhibited significant synergistic effects with the AR inhibitor bicalutamide. Transcriptome sequencing showed that this combination therapy activates ferroptosis, as evidenced by elevated ROS, increased Fe2+ levels, a reduced GSH/GSSG ratio, and lipid peroxide accumulation (MDA and 4-HNE). FOXC2 was identified as a key mediator of this synergy. Specifically, the combination therapy inhibits FOXC2-driven EMT and induces ferroptosis via the FOXC2-Hippo signaling axis, suppressing tumor proliferation, migration, and invasion. In summary, this study uncovers the value of AR/ERK co-targeting in TNBC, which might potentiate the development of novel targeted therapeutic strategies in TNBC.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-51">摘要</h3>
<p>Little is known about the physiological outcomes of unemployment during life. The aim of this study is to analyse if exposure to unemployment during different age periods can lead to metabolic syndrome (MetS) in middle-aged men and women. Can sensitive periods be identified? Data from the Northern Swedish Cohort was used, a longitudinal study of school leavers from 1981. Over the 40-year period, the retention rate was 90%. MetS at age 56 was measured with clinical examinations, while the exposure was measured with retrospective matrices between follow-ups. Exposure was cut into tertiles in each age group, the contribution to risk from each month of exposure was also analysed, using logistic regression. Short-term exposure to unemployment in early teens (&lt;12 weeks) as well as long-term exposure to unemployment during life (&gt;24 months) was related to MetS among women. In addition, exposure to unemployment &gt;24 months during age 22-30 was related to MetS in adult life among both men and women. A significant dose-response was found among men and women in the ages 22-30 and among women in the whole age period. All results were controlled for socioeconomic status, obesity and drinking, used as time-dependent confounders. Our study showed that long-term exposure to unemployment during life can lead to MetS in adult age among women. Sensitive periods were identified in young age among both men and women. Our findings can be understood as a maladaptive response to chronic stress over life becoming embodied as MetS in adult life and calls for offensive, age-adjusted gender-sensitive interventions on the labour market.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-52">摘要</h3>
<p>Soil elemental stoichiometry serves as an inherent link between soil biogeochemistry and the structure and processes within plant communities, and thus is at the core of ecosystem functions. Yet, the regulatory role of soil stoichiometry, particularly the carbon-to-nitrogen (C:N) ratio, in shaping biodiversity-productivity relationships remains poorly understood. By integrating data from our regional field surveys (58 sites) and a local complementary N addition experiment in temperate grasslands, together with a global grassland dataset (74 sites), here we showed that plant productivity exhibited a unimodal response to increasing soil C:N ratios, with peaking values at the C:N ratio of approximately 15. At this critical value, the determinants driving grassland productivity undergo a fundamental shift: below the soil C:N of 15, plant diversity was positively related to productivity, while above this threshold, bacterial and fungal diversity showed a positive linkage with plant productivity. This divergence implies a stoichiometric “switch” in biodiversity-productivity relationships: high soil C:N ratios strengthen the reliance of productivity on soil bacterial and fungal diversity to mitigate N deficiency, while low C:N ratios shift the emphasis to plant diversity to exploit resource-rich environments. Our findings highlight that soil stoichiometry can predict biodiversity-productivity relationships, with important implications for grassland restoration and management.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-53">摘要</h3>
<p>Population ageing and urbanisation are global trends that highlight the importance of cities as a nexus for policy and planning to support healthy ageing. This study assessed whether membership in the World Health Organization’s Age-Friendly Cities and Communities (AFCC) Network is associated with improved health behaviours and outcomes among older adults in urban Japan.
Three geographically diverse Japanese AFCCs (Akita, Takarazuka and Fujisawa) and one non-AFCC (Musashino) were selected. Quota samples of 175 middle-aged and older adults were obtained in each city (n = 700). Validated Japanese-language instruments measured physical activity (IPAQ-SF), environmental perceptions (IPAQ-ENV), health-related quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF) and expectations regarding ageing (ERA-12).
Over 60% of AFCC residents met physical activity guidelines, with walking as the dominant mode. However, AFCCs performed no better than the non-AFCC in terms of physical activity, health status or future health expectations. Akita, Japan’s longest-standing AFCC member, recorded significantly lower scores across all health and activity indicators. Environmental features, including walkability and access to services, were not significantly associated with sufficient weekly physical activity. Only physical health status was a significant predictor of adequate activity.
Membership of an AFCC Network was not associated with better physical activity or health outcomes in urban Japan. Findings raise concerns about the implementation and impact of the AFCC framework, highlighting the need for more robust evaluation, greater national coordination and participatory planning. Policy reform may be necessary to ensure that symbolic commitments to age-friendly planning are translated into tangible health benefits for older urban populations.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-54">摘要</h3>
<p>This study compared changes in handgrip strength (HGS) over 2 years in young athletes participating in two sports: kendo, which involves gripping equipment during play, and soccer, which does not.
One hundred eleven young athletes (54 kendo boys [mean age at baseline: 10.1 ± 1.7 years] and 57 soccer boys [mean age at baseline: 10.3 ± 1.8 years]) underwent three HGS measurements, spaced 1 year apart (Test 1, Test 2, and Test 3). The Q-Q plot indicated some violations of normality; therefore, we used a robust repeated measures ANOVA function in R.
We found evidence for a localized interaction effect (p = 0.02), with a sport difference in the change from Test 1 (baseline) to Test 3 and Test 2 to Test 3 (kendo &gt; soccer). There was no statistically significant main effect of sport (p = 0.06); however, kendo was on average 2.4 (95% CI: -0.08, 4.9) kg stronger than soccer athletes. When collapsing across groups, HGS increased from Test 1 to Test 2 by 1.9 (1.5, 2.3) kg, and from Test 2 to Test 3 by 2.8 (2.1, 3.6) kg.
Sports that involve gripping tools in conjunction with natural movements may help improve HGS during the developmental period.</p>

<p>Young carers provide significant care for their significant others, and this group of people is often hidden in schools and society. Previous research has shown that young carers face several wellbeing deficits. There is little nationally representative research on the health of this vulnerable group of young people.
This study first examined how young carer background is associated with psychosomatic symptoms among 16-18-year-olds in a general population. Secondly, the study analysed how young carer background and socio-demographic variables explain psychosomatic symptoms when confounding factors are controlled.
The data source was the School Health Promotion (SHP) study, a nationwide self-report survey of students (n = 61,448) in upper secondary and vocational schools in Finland. Chi-squared tests and logistic regression analyses were carried out.
Almost 9% of the students had experiences of caring relationships at least monthly, and 5% at least weekly. Psychosomatic symptoms were more frequent among 16-18-year-old students who had caring responsibilities at least weekly than among those who had caring responsibilities monthly or less often. In addition, several socio-demographic variables such as female gender, economic situation of the family, living with only one or without parents, and confounding factors, that is, self-perceived health and anxiety, were associated with psychosomatic symptoms. After controlling for all factors, this study found that a caring relationship was still associated with a higher frequency of perceived psychosomatic symptoms.
These findings could promote professionals in health promotion, health care, and education, to be more aware of the existence and support needs of young people with caring responsibilities.</p>
