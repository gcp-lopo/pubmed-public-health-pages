<h3 id="摘要">摘要</h3>
<p>In a previous phase 3 clinical trial, a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) induced robust immune responses in participants aged 2 years and older. We conducted this study to evaluate the immune persistence of a single dose of PPV23 6 years after vaccination. In this follow-up study, 600 participants aged 2 years and older (referred to the age of vaccination) who had received a single dose of either test vaccine or control vaccine in the previous clinical trial were enrolled in a 3:1 ratio. Blood samples were collected to determine anti-capsular immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody levels against 23 serotypes with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A total of 598 subjects were included for immune persistence analysis. Six years after vaccination, the geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) of IgG antibodies to most serotypes remained higher than prior to vaccination in both groups (1.1-1.8 folds vs.1.1-1.7 folds), although there was a significant decrease compared to 28 days. The results suggested PPV23 could provide protection 6 years after vaccination. Considering the significant decrease of antibody level, the revaccination in high-risk population may be needed.Trial registration: ClinicalTrial.gov identifier: NCT03480763.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-1">摘要</h3>
<p>Despite being key components of global tuberculosis policy, poverty reduction and social protection interventions have been inconsistently implemented. We aimed to characterise how poverty and interrelated personal risk factors increase tuberculosis risk in Peru to inform the design of locally appropriate, person-centred, equity-oriented interventions.
We undertook a case-control study among people aged 15 years and over in 32 communities in Peru between 2016 and 2019. Cases (n = 2337) were people diagnosed with any form of tuberculosis. Controls (n = 981) were people living in randomly selected households in the same communities. We derived measures of household poverty from three dimensions (physical, human, and financial capital) and investigated the associations between these; personal risk factors more specifically linked to health (e.g. smoking); and tuberculosis. We used logistic regression to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aOR), 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), and population attributable fractions (PAF). A directed acyclic graph was used to inform the analytical approach.
Household poverty was strongly associated with tuberculosis (aOR = 3.1; 95% CI: 2.3-4.2 for people from the ‘poorer’ versus ‘less poor’ half of households). There was a non-linear social gradient across deciles of household poverty, with odds of tuberculosis increasing exponentially as poverty deepened (aOR = 12.6; 95% CI: 6.8-23.2 for the ‘poorest’ decile versus the ‘least poor’ decile). Overall, tuberculosis burden could be halved by reducing poverty in the ‘poorer’ half of households to the level of the ‘less poor’ half (PAF = 47%; 95% CI: 40-54). For key personal risk factors, we estimated PAF for alcohol excess (PAF = 12.3%, 95% CI: 7.2-17.2); underweight (PAF = 10.3%, 95% CI: 8.7-11.8); smoking (PAF = 8.8%, 95% CI: 3.8-13.5); HIV (PAF = 5.7%, 95% CI: 4.6-6.7); and diabetes (PAF = 4.6%, 95% CI: 3.3-6.0). We also identified other important risk factors including previous tuberculosis (PAF = 14.8%, 95% CI: 11.6-17.9); incarceration (PAF = 9.5%, 95% CI: 6.8-12.1); and lower social capital (PAF = 4.1%, 95% CI: 2.6-5.6). Most personal risk factors, particularly education and substance misuse, tuberculosis exposures (e.g. incarceration and homelessness), and undernutrition, exhibited a social gradient across quintiles of household poverty and were more prevalent in people living in poorer households (Cochran-Armitage test for linear trend P &lt; 0.001 for variables showing these social gradients).
Interventions addressing multidimensional household poverty and interrelated personal risk factors could substantially reduce tuberculosis burden. Our results provide an evidence base for designing person-centred, equity-oriented interventions; and support more effective implementation of poverty reduction and social protection within the global tuberculosis response.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-2">摘要</h3>
<p>The seasonal cycle of the influenza virus causes substantial morbidity and mortality globally. The impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on the circulation of influenza viruses can influence influenza-associated excess mortality. Given the few studies that have explored this topic, the objective of this study was to evaluate influenza-associated excess mortality in the Chinese mainland from 2012 to 2021 and quantify the changes from 2020 to 2021 compared with 2012-2019.
Using data from national influenza surveillance report and disease surveillance points, we fitted a generalized additive model on all-cause (AC), pneumonia &amp; influenza (P&amp;I), and respiratory (R) mortality rates. In this model, we included data of influenza activity (A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B), temperature, absolute humidity, the COVID-19 pandemic, and time trends. The excess mortality was estimated by subtracting the fitted baseline mortality from the predicted mortality, which set influenza activity to zero.
The respiratory mortality model explained more than 90% of the variance, indicating the good performance. We found that the influenza-associated mortality was generally decreasing from 2020 to 2021, for instance, influenza A/H1N1-associated excess respiratory mortality (ERM) decreased from 2.62 per 100,000 persons (95% confidence interval: 0.16-5.21) to 0.31 (0.02-0.60) in the northern region and from 3.79 (0.09-7.05) to 0.24 (0.02-0.46) in the southern region between 2012-2019 and 2020-2021. A similar pattern was observed for A/H3N2-associated ERM. While the influenza B remained similar scale, for instance, the ERM was 2.90 (0.72-4.3) and 2.26 (1.76-2.76) in the southern region between 2012-2019 and 2020-2021, respectively. Distinct pattern was observed for the AC and P&amp;I outcomes.
The COVID-19 pandemic has reduced influenza-associated excess mortality, which may be a result of the reduced activity of the influenza virus caused by nonpharmaceutical interventions. Different patterns of regional differences differed for influenza-associated AC, P&amp;I and R mortality. It should be noticed that the contribution of influenza B was generally similar when comparing 2012-2019 and 2020-2021, which highlighted the attention on the influenza B activity. Additional studies are needed to explore the changes in influenza-associated excess mortality afterwards.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-3">摘要</h3>
<p>Traditional in-person neuropsychological tests remain inaccessible and not adapted to individuals in remote geographical locations and linguistically diverse populations. We aimed to make neuropsychological tests more accessible and adapted to diverse populations by leveraging the internet. We examined the feasibility, discriminability, and generalizability of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment-video conferencing version (MoCA-VC) across geographically and linguistically diverse populations. We tested 250 participants from 120+ locations in the USA and Israel, using a standardized MoCA-VC protocol in English, Hebrew, or Arabic. Performance followed expected significant trends across language-speaking cohorts: young adults (YA)&gt;older adults (OA)&gt;people with Parkinson’s Disease (PwP), confirming discriminative abilities. However, while the YA groups performed similarly across the three language-speaking cohorts, the OA and PwP Arabic-speaking cohorts demonstrated significantly lower scores, indicating limited generalizability. While these findings support MoCA-VC’s feasibility and discriminability, they underscore the need to adapt online cognitive assessments across geographical locations and languages, ensuring greater accessibility worldwide.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-4">摘要</h3>
<p>Poverty, disease, and vector ecology intersect to present ongoing health threats, particularly in ecologically sensitive regions. Guizhou Province in China, with its complex karst topography and rich biodiversity, offers a unique environment to study mosquito-borne viral transmission. Despite over 5000 reported cases of Japanese encephalitis in the past two decades and the detection of Zika virus in 2016, the virological landscape of this region remains poorly understood. This study aims to characterize the mosquito-associated virome, assess viral diversity, and identify factors influencing transmission dynamics in Guizhou Province.
Between 2021 and 2022, we conducted a 2-year mosquito surveillance across eight ecologically distinct regions in Guizhou Province. Adult mosquitoes were collected using a variety of methods, including BG Mosquitaire CO2 traps, mosquito-killing lamps, manual collection, human bait traps, and oviposition traps. To investigate the virome diversity and dynamics within mosquito populations, we performed metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatics analysis on pooled mosquito samples collected from geographically diverse sampling sites.
We collected more than 40,000 adult mosquitoes, primarily belonging to four genera: Aedes, Anopheles, Armigeres, and Culex. Dominant species included Aedes albopictus, Anopheles sinensis, Armigeres subalbatus, and Culex tritaeniorhynchus. Notably, we report the first provincial record of the Anopheles baileyi complex, expanding the known distribution of mosquito vector in this region. Viral metagenomic sequencing, coupled with bioinformatic analysis, identified 162 viral contigs, including 140 known and 22 previously uncharacterized viruses. We experimentally confirmed the genotypes of three medically important zoonotic viruses: Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV-GI), Getah virus (GETV-GIII) and Banna virus (BAV-A2). Comparative analysis of viral abundance across mosquito species revealed that Aedes albopictus populations in Guizhou harbor a distinct virome composition, diverging from those reported in other geographic regions.
This study presents the comprehensive characterization of the mosquito-associated virome in Guizhou Province, providing critical insights into viral diversity, vector competence, and transmission dynamics within karst ecosystems. The detection of multiple zoonotic viruses highlights the need for strengthened surveillance and targeted public health interventions in this region.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-5">摘要</h3>
<p>Each spring, migratory birds converge along the Croatian coast from various directions, creating a dynamic intersection of flight paths. Many birds are thought to cross the Adriatic Sea, while others follow a northward route along the coastline. As most migratory birds initiate flight shortly after sunset, we hypothesized that sea-crossing migrants would arrive with a delay at the Croatian coast, compared to migrants that were following the coast, resulting in potentially intricate spatiotemporal patterns that remain poorly understood.
We deployed four ornithological radar devices along the Croatian coastline: two in southwestern Istria and two in northern Dalmatia. These radars tracked migratory bird activity up to 1000 m above ground, recording intensity and flight directions and their variations across sites, seasons, and individual nights. We conducted an exploratory analysis of these variations, applied functional principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering to summarise within-night activity profiles, and compared these profiles between sites and across the migration season, alongside associated flight direction distributions.
During the early migration season, migration intensity was similar across all technically active sites, but site-to-site variation increased markedly in May. In March, flight directions were predominantly towards NNE, indicating mainly sea-crossing migration throughout the night. In April, NW directions dominated the first half of the night, shifting to scattered N directions later; in Dalmatia, even strong W components were observed early in the night. By May, W to NW movement towards the Italian coast were typical for early-night activity. Later in the night, flight directions shifted towards NE over Istria and N at the Dalmatian site in Zadar, while the site at Vrana exhibited a wide scatter, warranting further discussion. Contrary to our expectations, within-night intensity profiles could not be fully linked to specific directional patterns.
This study points to the complex interplay between coastal and sea-crossing migration along the Croatian coast. Our results demonstrate significant variability in the timing of migration within single nights in the context of aquatic barriers. Crossing such a barrier results in downstream delays compared to birds migrating along the barrier. Between nights, one behaviour or the other may dominate the overall activity, causing the shifts in within-night timing. In addition, barrier crossing is likely to be strongly influenced by weather conditions, contributing to the variability in the within-night timing of migration. However, measured flight directions were not always consistent with within-night timing, highlighting the complexity of avian migration in the context of aquatic barriers. This highlights the need for further research with high temporal resolution to gain a deeper understanding of migration behaviour in response to such barriers.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-6">摘要</h3>
<p>Despite the established evidence that physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep affect cognitive function individually, less is known about the combined effects of these movement behaviors. The study aimed to identify movement patterns of physical activity, sitting time, and sleep and to examine the association of movement patterns with cognitive function.
This cross-sectional study included 1,240 participants aged ≥ 55 years participating in the Cooper Center Longitudinal Study who visited the Cooper Clinic, Dallas (2016-2019) for preventive health care. Four movement behaviors were self-reported, including leisure-time aerobic activity, muscle-strengthening activity, sitting time, sleep, and other characteristics. Cognitive function was assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Four categorical indicators were created for each movement behavior and used to identify latent classes. Information criterion, scaled relative entropy and model interpretability were used to determine the optimal number of classes. Participants were assigned to the predicted classes based on their highest posterior probabilities. Multinomial regressions examined the association between movement patterns and each covariate. Linear and logistic regression models examined the association of movement patterns and cognitive function. A sensitivity analysis accounted for misclassification errors.
Participants were predominantly White (95%), male (71%), with an average age of 62 years. A 3-class model was selected, comprising class 1: active long sleepers, class 2: very active short sleepers, and class 3: moderately active short sleepers, representing 11%, 62%, and 27% of the sample. Compared to class 2, class 1 was more likely to be older and female, while class 3 was more likely to be female, have less education, be overweight and obese, and have chronic conditions. Compared to class 2, class 3 was associated with a lower MoCA total score, adjusting for sociodemographic factors. There were no differences in MoCA total score between class 2 and class 3 when further controlling for health behaviors and indicators. Sensitivity analysis accounting for misclassification suggested that class 3 had a significantly lower average MoCA total score than class 2.
The current study identified three distinct movement classes that exhibited different sociodemographic, health characteristics and cognitive functions. Findings highlight that less active, more sedentary, and shorter sleep individuals had worse cognitive function.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-7">摘要</h3>
<p>Dietary recommendation plays a quintessential role in diabetes self-management. Persons living with diabetes (PLWD) are expected to consume diets rich in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes and nuts, while limiting alcohol consumption, refined grains, red and processed meats, and low sugar-sweetened beverages. However, the following questions remain: (a) What is the association between dietary adherence and depression among persons living with diabetes in Ghana? (b) Do adherence to a general diet and specific diet recommendations have the same association with depression? To address these questions, we examined the association between dietary self-care adherence and depression among PLWD in Ghana.
This cross-sectional study was conducted in the Ashanti region of Ghana. The study involved 398 PLWD. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression models were performed to assess the association between dietary adherence and depression. The results of the multivariable logistic regression were presented in adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical significance was set at &lt; 0.05.
Overall, we estimated a depression prevalence of 38.7% among the participants. PLWD who had a high dietary self-care adherence were significantly less likely to experience depression (COR = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.11-0.66). This association remained statistically significant after adjusting for covariates (AOR = 0.28; 95% CI: 0.10-0.78). While a high general diet score was associated with lower odds of depression, it was statistically not significant. However, PLWD with a higher specific diet score were significantly less likely to experience depressive symptoms (AOR = 0.80; 95% CI: 0.73-0.88).
The significant inverse association between adherence to specific diets and depression points to an area that clinicians and public health authorities must prioritise. Our findings suggest that encouraging PLWD to adhere to specific diet recommendations (e.g., fruit and vegetable consumption, practicing carbohydrate spacing, and consuming low-fat diets) could help reduce the risk of depression. Hence, clinicians must emphasise the mental health benefits of adhering to dietary recommendations during their dietary counselling sessions with PLWD.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-8">摘要</h3>
<p>Despite the importance of engaging community members in research, multiple barriers from the perspective of the investigator and community member exist. The Making Research CLEAR (Community Learning and Experience about Research) Program aims to bridge the gap between research conducted at an NCI-designated cancer center and the community.
Community members and a cancer center investigator were paired for a 6-month immersive research experience. Community members had at least one research experience per month with their investigator, while also attending cancer center activities such as Institutional Review Board (IRB) meetings, research lectures, protocol review meetings, and community outreach events. Community members and investigators completed baseline and endpoint surveys to assess perceptions and impact of the program.
Seven community member-investigator dyads completed the program. There was strong agreement among community members that participation increased their awareness (Pre M = 4.0, Post M = 4.43) and understanding (Pre M = 3.43, Post M = 4.57) of current cancer research efforts, although there was decreased agreement that their participation would add value to the research (Pre M = 4.71, Post M = 4.57). Community members had increased interest in participating in clinical trials (Pre M = 4.29, Post M = 4.43) and their attitudes towards trials improved (Pre M = 4.57, Post M = 4.71). Their confidence in the safety and benefit of clinical trials was high at baseline (M = 4.71) yet remained unchanged at endpoint. Researchers strongly agreed that the program offered an opportunity to build trust between researchers and community members (Pre M = 4.57, Post M = 5.00) and it improved their understanding of the community’s culture (Pre M = 4.57, Post M = 4.86).
Overall, measures of community members’ trust and transparency in research and clinical trials increased yet perceptions of their impact on research were mixed. Community input may have limited ability to directly impact the scientific process in a span of 6 months, but researchers’ willingness to partner with community members in the future is promising.
The Making Research CLEAR program, launched by the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center in Philadelphia, aims to build trust between cancer researchers and community members by involving the public directly in the research process. Trust is especially crucial in cancer research, where sharing personal health data is often required. The program gives community members hands-on lab experiences and fosters open dialogue about cancer research. Initially piloted in 2022, CLEAR paired community members with researchers for 8–12 weeks. Based on participant feedback, the 2023 version expanded to six months and included better training materials. Participants, often local leaders or advocates, were matched with researchers based on shared interests. They took part in lab work, monthly meetings, and educational events focused on topics like clinical trials and research ethics. Evaluations showed that community members gained a better understanding of cancer research and felt more confident in it. Most said the program had a positive impact and would recommend it. However, some questioned whether their input truly influenced researchers or built lasting trust. Researchers, on the other hand, strongly valued community involvement, noting improved communication skills and a greater desire to collaborate with the public. Despite some differing views, both community members and researchers saw CLEAR as a beneficial initiative. The program underscores the need for open communication between scientists and the community, with the goal of improving both trust and cancer research outcomes. Future improvements may focus on fostering shared dialogue to strengthen these relationships.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-9">摘要</h3>
<p>Rapid urbanization is accelerating in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), which impacts health behaviors and contributes to noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), such as diabetes and hypertension. As primary care services are overstretched, urban residents rely on pharmacies, creating an urgent need to implement evidence-based approaches such as the World Health Organization’s Package of Essential Non-communicable Diseases (PEN) to reach low-income households at risk of hypertension and diabetes. This study aims to identify the facilitators and barriers to the adoption, implementation, and long-term delivery of strategies to link pharmacies with public facilities in Pokhara Metropolitan City Nepal, to improve diabetes and hypertension prevention and management among poor urban populations.
This study uses a sequential mixed-method design within the RE-AIM framework. Data from client surveys will assess the costs and effectiveness of system linkages and interventions in improving diabetes and hypertension screening, management, and referral. Data will be collected at four time points from at least 20 clients per pharmacy and public health facility at baseline, midline, and endline and, to assess maintenance of delivery, post endline. During each time point, repeat questionnaires will be used to assess clients’ adherence to lifestyle and referral advice. The quantitative data will be analyzed via descriptive statistics and logistic regression models to identify factors associated with change in major outcomes. Qualitative data from semi-structured interviews with health workers at pharmacies, clients, and public health facility staff will be analyzed via thematic analysis to identify barriers to and facilitators of intervention adoption, implementation, and sustainability. Endline and post-endline surveys will replicate baseline methods to evaluate intervention impact.
This study will provide insights into how private pharmacies can be linked to the public health system to provide appropriate, quality services for diabetes and hypertension within the context of a pluralistic urban health system. Using the RE-AIM framework will enable assessment across implementation domains, providing valuable insights for local governments and health systems within Nepal. Given the rapid urbanization and increasing prevalence of NCDs, which characterize the majority of LMICs, our study contributes to the understanding of how to implement such strategies to meet the needs of the urban poor in other similar contexts.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-10">摘要</h3>
<p>Many studies have shown that coffee and tea consumption is associated with diabetes. However, limited research exists on their effects on the risk of macrovascular complications in diabetic patients. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between the intake of coffee and tea and macrovascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
We used the Cox proportional hazards regression model to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI), which determined the relationship between coffee and tea consumption and the risk of macrovascular complications among 14,277 UK Biobank participants.
Compared with non-coffee or tea drinkers, those who consumed 0.5-1 cup of coffee (HR 0.67,95% CI 0.518 to 0.856) or 2-4 cups of tea (HR 0.66,95% CI 0.524 to 0.839) per day had the lowest risk of stroke; daily intake of 2-4 cups of coffee associated with reduced risk of angina pectoris (AP) (HR 0.82,95% CI 0.726 to 0.916); those who consumed 0.5-1 cup of tea per day had the lowest risk of the heart failure (HF) (HR 0.73,95% CI 0.602 to 0.879); furthermore, those who consumed 2-4 cups of coffee and 0.5-1 cup of tea per day (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.379-0.790) demonstrated the lowest risk of HF onset compared with those who did not consume coffee and tea at all.
This study found that in a T2DM population, moderate coffee consumption significantly lowered the risk of stroke and AP, while moderate tea intake reduced the risk of stroke and HF. Combined moderate consumption of both beverages provided optimal protection against HF.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-11">摘要</h3>
<p>Plasma amyloid-tau-neurodegeneration (ATN) biomarker levels may be influenced by non-brain systems, such as kidney function, which could impact the interpretation of ATN biomarker results, particularly in groups like Hispanic/Latino individuals with higher rates of cardiometabolic health issues. Here, we examine the association between kidney function and plasma ATN markers among a diverse sample of Hispanic/Latino individuals living in the U.S.
Data was collected from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL, Visit 1, 2008-2011), the largest prospective cohort study of noninstitutionalized Hispanic/Latino adults in the U.S., and its ancillary study, the Study of Latinos-Investigation of Neurocognitive Aging (SOL-INCA) which was conducted during the second visit of the parent HCHS/SOL study (Visit 2, 2015-2018). SOL-INCA aimed to examine the neurocognitive decline of middle-aged and older Hispanic/Latino adults, and the inclusion criteria were the age of 50-years and older by Visit 2 and completion of battery of neurocognitive tests at Visit 1. Survey linear regression models were used to examine associations between CKD status (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73m2 or urine albumin-creatinine ratio [uACR]) &gt;= 30 mg/g) and the plasma ATN biomarkers (β-amyloid 42/40 ratio [Aβ42/40 ratio], phosphorylated-tau181 [p-Tau181], neurofilament light [NfL], and glial fibrillary associated protein [GFAP]), independently. All models adjusted for sociodemographic and cardiometabolic factors (BMI, diabetes, and hypertension).
5,968 participants were included in the study (mean age 63.4 ± 8.1, 54% women). CKD was associated with higher p-Tau181 (b = 0.82), NfL (b = 11.60) and GFAP levels (b = 31.41), and lower Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio (b=-0.004). Lower eGFR (i.e., reduced kidney function) was associated with higher p-Tau181, NfL, and GFAP levels (b ranges [-0.87 - -0.03]), and lower Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio (b = 0.000). Higher (natural log) uACR was associated with lower Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio and higher levels of all other biomarkers (b ranges [0.24-5.49]). Additionally, CKD, eGFR, and uACR were associated with ATN biomarkers in models adjusted for cardiometabolic risk factors, diabetes and hypertension.
CKD status, kidney function and urinary markers of kidney damage are significant confounders in the interpretation of plasma ATN biomarker levels.</p>

<p>Atezolizumab (A) plus carboplatin-etoposide (CE) represents the new first-line treatment in extensive stage (ES)-Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) patients. This study aims at identifying the association of baseline and dynamic changes of cfDNA, Tumor Fraction (TF) and variant allele frequency (VAF) of tumor-related mutations with median (m) overall (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) in SCLC patients treated with ACE.
This is a single-center prospective exploratory study including treatment-naive ES-SCLC patients eligible to first-line ACE. Liquid biopsies were longitudinally collected at baseline (T0), after cycle 1 (T1) and 2 (T2), at disease progression (T3). cfDNA Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis was performed; genomic profiles and TF were inferred from shallow WGS (sWGS).
Thirty-two patients were included; mPFS and mOS were 5.19 and 7.96 months, respectively. Higher T0 cfDNA (HR 1.44, 95% CI 1.17-1.77, p = 0.0006) and VAF (HR 2.6, 95% CI 1.36-4.93, p = 0.0039) were associated with risk of death; higher T0 cfDNA (HR 1.29, 95% CI 1.08-1.54, p = 0.0049), TF (HR 1.97, 95% CI 1.02-3.82, p = 0.044) and VAF (HR 2.32, 95% CI 1.22-4.42, p = 0.01) were predictors of risk of PD. Among the dynamic changes in the biomarkers under investigation, the association of 10-unit increase of VAF T0-T1 and T0-T2 with OS (HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.01-1.88, p = 0.043; HR 1.56, 95% CI 1.21-2.16, p = 0.008) and PFS (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.18-2.43, p = 0.004; HR 1.81, 95% CI 1.22-2.70, p = 0.003) was estimated.
T0 and dynamic changes of cfDNA, TF and VAF may help physicians to stratify ES-SCLC patients receiving first-line ACE and to anticipate the clinical course of the disease.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-13">摘要</h3>
<p>The number of published cost-effectiveness analyses in dental medicine has substantially increased in recent years. A key methodological issue in these analyses is how to address uncertainty in costs and effects, which also impacts uncertainty around the expected cost-effectiveness ratio. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve has become the standard method to summarize uncertainty in probabilistic cost-effectiveness analyses. However, it does not inform decision-makers about budget impact or account for the fact that they are often risk-averse. The cost-effectiveness affordability curve and the cost-effectiveness risk-aversion curve have been proposed to address these limitations. In this systematic review, we assess how uncertainty has been handled in cost-effectiveness analyses in dental medicine, with a particular focus on affordability and risk-aversion.
We conducted a systematic literature search across electronic databases (MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EconLit, Embase) on April 18, 2025, and performed manual searches of selected references. Articles published after January 1, 2021, were included. From each study, we extracted information on the first author, year of publication, country, intervention evaluated, study design (model-based, trial-based, or combined), use of deterministic and/or probabilistic sensitivity analysis, and whether budget impact and risk-aversion were considered.
From a total of 57 published cost-effectiveness analyses, 49 (85%) used a deterministic sensitivity analysis and 37 (65%) used a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Budget impact analysis was performed in five studies (9%), and only one study formally applied both the cost-effectiveness affordability curve and the cost-effectiveness risk-aversion curve.
The use of methods to address uncertainty related to budget constraints and risk-aversion remains limited in dental medicine. As decision-makers often operate within budget constraints and health is considered the most valuable good, incorporating methods that address affordability and risk-aversion could enhance the relevance and impact of cost-effectiveness analyses in dental care.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-15">摘要</h3>
<p>Understanding determinants of antibiotic use during pregnancy is crucial for optimizing their utilization in clinical practice. We aimed to investigate which individual-level factors are associated with antibiotic use among pregnant women.
Population-based cohort study using linked data from the Swedish national health and population registers spanning from 2006 to 2019. Sociodemographic characteristics, medical and obstetric history, lifestyle and healthcare utilization were investigated as independent variables. Any systemic antibiotic use during pregnancy, the primary outcome, was determined from filled prescriptions, with broad-spectrum antibiotics and multiple courses of antibiotics as secondary outcomes. Multiple logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs), including all independent variables in the model.
Among 20 variables associated with any systemic antibiotic use during pregnancy, preconception prescription drug use (OR 1.93 [95% CI 1.87-1.98] for &gt; 4 vs. 0-1 unique therapeutic subgroups), chronic renal disease (1.82 [1.73-1.93]) and low maternal age (1.67 [1.61-1.74] for ages &lt; 20 vs. 30-34 years) had the highest odds. Chronic renal disease, immunodeficiency disorders and preconception drug use (&gt; 4 vs. 0-1 therapeutic subgroups) had the highest odds of broad-spectrum antibiotic use and use of multiple antibiotic courses.
Pre-existing morbidities and low maternal age were most strongly associated with antibiotic use during pregnancy, suggesting a needs-based approach in prescribing. Proactive management of morbidities and infection prevention strategies, particularly targeting young women of reproductive age, could potentially reduce the need for antibiotic treatment in prenatal care.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-16">摘要</h3>
<p>To assess the utility of DWI-MRI to differentiate arteritic (A-AION) from non-arteritic (NA-AION) ischemic optic neuropathy.
This bicentric cohort-study evaluated 3T DWI-MRI scans performed within 10 days after onset of AION in patients treated between 2014 and 2024 at two tertiary care centers. DWI was first assessed for the presence of restricted diffusion within the optic nerve. Quantitative apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) evaluation was performed by placing a region of interest (ROI) within the affected optic nerve. Qualitative and quantitative DWI assessments were compared between A-AION and NA-AION patients.
Twenty A-AION patients (75.7 ± 6.8 years; 16 [80.0%] female) and 59 NA-AION patients (64.6 ± 10.7 years; 22 [37.3%] female) with a total of 82 (A-AION: 23; NA-AION: 59) DWI-MRI scans were included in the study. Restricted diffusion on ADC was significantly more frequent in A-AION, when compared to NA-AION (82.6% vs. 42.4%; p = 0.001). Corresponding sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of qualitative ADC assessment for the identification of A-AION were 0.83, 0.58, 0.43 and 0.89. Quantitative ADC analysis revealed significantly lower values in optic nerves affected by A-AION (ADC: 448.0 ± 256.2 × 10-6 mm2/s vs. 671.5 ± 174.9 × 10-6 mm2/s, p = 0.002).
Restricted diffusion of the optic nerve is more frequent in A-AION and associated with lower optic nerve ADC values, when compared to NA-AION. Prospective studies are required to further explore the potential of DWI in discerning arteritic from non-arteritic AION.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-17">摘要</h3>
<p>Parental gambling disorder has detrimental financial, psychological, physiological, familial, and behavioral implications for the offspring, making these children highly vulnerable. In Germany, population-based estimates on how many minor children have parents with gambling disorder are lacking; thus, the immediacy of need for corresponding (public) health care policies remains unknown.
Based on the population-representative German Gambling Survey 2023, we estimated the number of children having parents with gambling disorder, including estimates for rates at each parental gambling disorder severity level (mild, moderate, severe). Both cohabiting children and separate living children were considered. To extrapolate lower and upper bounds of estimates, data on number of parents in the household and average number of children was combined with official population statistics.
Of 282 participants with gambling disorder, 46.8% (n = 132) cohabit with 1.55 children on average; 16.7% (n = 47) are parents of 1.51 separate living children on average. Therefore, in Germany 574,079 to 604,966 children have a parent with gambling disorder, with about 84.0% of them (482,076 to 508,712) cohabiting with the gambling parent. The likelihood of cohabiting decreases with increasing gambling disorder severity (mild: 97.7%; moderate: 85.0%; severe: 72.2%).
In Germany about 1 in 25 children has a parent with gambling disorder. Given that parental gambling disorder is an established risk factor for developing own gambling problems, more comprehensive addiction care and health policy are needed to address this issue. Integrated care and counselling offers targeting both gambling parents and their children may be a promising starting point. Special attention should be paid to separate living children in these approaches.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-18">摘要</h3>
<p>Infections caused by anaerobes are common in children. However, limited data are available on bloodstream infections caused by these bacteria in Europe. A multicentre retrospective observational study was conducted over a 4-year period (2020-2023) across 44 European hospitals to analyze all anaerobes isolated from blood cultures. The study examined the epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance profiles of anaerobes identified in paediatric patients, comparing the findings with those observed in adults. Among the 14,527 total anaerobic isolates, 186 (1.3%) were detected from paediatric patients. These were predominantly Gram-positive (70%) and Gram-negative (22%) bacilli. The most prevalent species in paediatric patients were Cutibacterium acnes (24.7%), Schaalia odontolytica (9.7%), Actinomyces oris (8.1%), and Bacteroides fragilis (7.5%). Relative feature importance based on the mean SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values distinguished paediatric patients and adults based on their antibiotic resistance patterns with high accuracy. Compared to those from adult patients, Gram-positive bacilli detected in paediatric samples displayed higher resistance rates for meropenem (15% vs. 9%), metronidazole (52% vs. 24%), and vancomycin (27% vs. 6%), and lower resistance to benzylpenicillin (11% vs. 17%), amoxicillin/clavulanate (9% vs. 17%), and clindamycin (30% vs. 36%). Gram-negative bacilli in paediatric samples displayed lower resistance to benzylpenicillin (18% vs. 29%), piperacillin/tazobactam (26% vs. 33%), and clindamycin (20% vs. 27%), and they were highly susceptible to imipenem, meropenem, and metronidazole as those detected in adult patients. Bacteroides species detected in paediatric and adult patients displayed high resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam (33% vs. 39%) and clindamycin (38% vs. 29%), while they were highly susceptible to metronidazole. Compared to those from adult samples, Cutibacterium acnes in paediatric patients displayed lower resistance to benzylpenicillin (none vs. 15%) and clindamycin (17% vs. 29%). The comparison of species and susceptibility profiles of anaerobes detected in paediatric and adult patients highlighted the importance of reporting antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance data by age group.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-20">摘要</h3>
<p>Dog ownership has been reported to positively influence the lives of individuals with substance use disorder (SUD) fostering social connection, a sense of belonging, and greater daily structure. However, the specific ways in which dog ownership impacts substance use and mental health remain underexplored. This study aimed to explore how people with SUD perceived that dog ownership affected their use of substances and mental health characteristics.
Qualitative, semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with eight individuals with experience of dog ownership and SUD. Data were gathered and analysed using a 4-step qualitative content analysis.
Three key categories emerged from the analysis. The unique relationship with their dog encouraged the development of a new sense of self for participants that had not been previously possible. Participants reported an increased awareness and regulation of substance use, and they became more mindful of their use, often reducing or managing it to align with caring for their dog. The bond with their dog contributed to improved mental health, emotional stability and appeared to play a role in reducing suicidal ideation.
Dog ownership provided participants with a positive sense of self and reinforced feelings of self-worth. This helped them move away from impulsive or habitual substance use patterns and adopt a more intentional, less harmful approach. The relationship with the dog also appeared to stabilise participants’ mental health, enabling them to navigate depressive episodes more effectively and recover from negative moods more easily.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-21">摘要</h3>
<p>Substance use disorder remains a United States public health concern, particularly for minoritized populations. This systematic review explores the relationship between workforce diversity, cultural competency, and the quality of substance use disorder treatment for minoritized populations. Studies published between 2003 and 2023 were analyzed and nine studies met inclusion criteria. Findings reveal conflicting evidence about the impact of workforce diversity and cultural competency on quality outcomes. While some studies suggest positive associations, others report no relationship or adverse effects. Moreover, inconsistencies in research methodology limited comparative analyses. The literature predominantly focuses on Hispanic/Latinx populations, leaving gaps in understanding other minoritized populations’ experiences. Despite national initiatives promoting health equity and diversity, federal research funding regarding substance use disorder treatment for minoritized populations remains limited. This review calls for further research to inform policy and practice, emphasizing multi-agency collaboration, standardized measures of cultural competency, and targeted funding to address disparities in treatment quality outcomes for minoritized populations.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-22">摘要</h3>
<p>The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) emphasize the critical need to reduce maternal and infant mortality and improve maternal health, which necessitates access to high-quality reproductive health (RH) services. By developing a comprehensive list of indicators, this study aims to support evidence-based decision-making and policy adjustments that respond to national and international reproductive health needs.
This is a scoping review from 2000 until 2020 in the international databases including PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Cochrane, WHO website, and ProQuest. We included studies that had abstracts, English language, and involved indicators related to reproductive health indicators. The selected articles were reviewed by two members of the team and then approved by the corresponding author. After collecting the primary indicators and removing duplications, the thematic classification of indicators was done.
We found 2026 studies from three databases and excluded 301 duplicates. After reviewing the abstract, 250 and by reading the full text, 23 studies were included. Most studies were about reproductive health indicators that are indirectly practical in the measurement of reproductive health policies. Most of the studies were systematic reviews. The most frequent indicator among the included studies was the total fertility rate.
Effective monitoring of childbearing encouragement programs and reproductive health policies requires a multi-level approach, encompassing indicators that can be applied from health-center to national levels. This review has categorized existing indicators to provide a structured framework for evaluating population policies. The selected indicators from this review can serve as a guideline for policymakers to create customized monitoring systems that address the specific needs of their countries.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-23">摘要</h3>
<p>Interventions to increase and maintain Hispanic women’s moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) are lacking. Socioecological models hypothesize that MVPA participation is influenced by factors at multiple levels of the environment (i.e., intrapersonal, interpersonal, organizational, neighborhood, policy). These factors, including behavior change mechanisms (BCM), are targeted with behavior change techniques (BCT) delivered through interventions to improve MVPA participation. However, the specific factors and BCT that positively influence Hispanic women’s MVPA remain unknown.
Synthesize existing literature to determine the socioecological model levels, BCM, and BCT that significantly increased Hispanic women’s accelerometer-measured MVPA.
Databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Cochrane Library and PsychINFO) were searched using key terms ((Hispanic women) OR (Hispanic OR Mexican American OR Latina OR Latinx) AND (female) AND (exercise OR physical activity)) without date or geographic limitations in March 2023. Peer-reviewed studies published in English that tested interventions to increase Hispanic women’s accelerometer-measured MVPA were included. Two authors extracted data, a narrative synthesis was conducted, and a conceptual model of a multilevel MVPA intervention was proposed.
Nine unique interventions were identified with four studies providing additional findings (N = 13). Studies were conducted in the United States and totaled 2,303 Hispanic women (M = 28.4-44.6 years). Self-efficacy (intrapersonal level) and family participation (interpersonal level) were the only BCM that mediated MVPA post-intervention. Half of the studies targeting the organizational (n = 3/6) and 83.3% (n = 5/6) targeting the neighborhood levels demonstrated significant improvements in MVPA. BCT targeting confidence, goals, and problem-solving at the intrapersonal level, partner support and childcare barriers at the interpersonal level, and physical activity access with methods to overcome weather and safety barriers at the neighborhood level significantly improved MVPA post-intervention. None of the interventions tested for longer-term (i.e., &gt; 9-months post-intervention) MVPA change.
Interventions to increase Hispanic women’s accelerometer-measured MVPA in the shorter-term should be developed to include BCT to increase self-efficacy (intrapersonal level) and family participation (interpersonal level) and identify physical activity opportunities/access (neighborhood level), including BCT to overcome safety and weather barriers. Future research is needed to confirm these findings and determine the socioecological levels, BCM, and BCT to maintain Hispanic women’s MVPA in the longer term.
The 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist was followed for this systematic review. The protocol for this systematic review was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), registration number CRD42021285063.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-24">摘要</h3>
<p>Some individuals carry a very low expression of the D-antigen, called a Del phenotype. Red cell units from such blood donors with DEL alleles are RhD protein-positive, despite being routinely labelled D-negative. Molecular typing offers a more sensitive method to identify Del individuals by detecting the presence of the RHD gene. Pools of 20 or more donor samples are routinely screened for the RHD gene in some, mostly European, donor populations.
A modular real-time PCR assay targeting RHD intron 4, exon 5, and exon 7 was developed for individual testing. We screened for the RHD gene among all blood donors who typed D-negative in routine serology.
Over 15 years, 2254 D-negative donors were individually tested for the RHD gene. With a sensitivity of detecting 5 RHD positive gDNA copies per reaction, 42 donors tested positive (1.9%). Among them, 34 carried the common RHDΨ allele (80.9%), while 7 harbored 5 known RHD alleles, and 1 a novel RHD deletion. We inadvertently detected 2 other donors with DVI, establishing a population frequency of 1 in 731 for the U.S.
A modular approach for RHD screening is suitable for blood donors when sample pooling is not feasible among multiethnic donor populations. We transitioned donors since 2009 from serologic D-negative to molecularly RHD-negative status at the NIH Clinical Center. Molecular RHD screening of serologic D-negative donors is an effective way to identify individuals harboring DEL alleles that can cause alloimmunization in transfusion recipients.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-25">摘要</h3>
<p>Despite the intentional focus of national programs and strategies in last decade, unmarried adolescents and youth (AY) face multiple challenges related to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) information, and access to health and counseling services. With massive urbanization and growing slum and more focus on married youth, the situation and need of unmarried AY are often overlooked. The present study explores the SRH need of AY to gain a holistic understanding of the SRH landscape in the context of slums of Uttar Pradesh, India.
A formative qualitative study was conducted in the slums of two cities in Uttar Pradesh using qualitative research techniques-in-depth interviews (IDI) and focus group discussions (FGDs) with unmarried adolescents and youths aged 15-24 years. Thematic analysis was guided by principles of grounded theory and narrative inquiry, both inductive and deductive approaches.
The study found limited awareness of SRH issues and often inaccurate knowledge of modern contraceptives among the unmarried youth.Gendered access to SRH information emerged clearly, with boys benefitting from wider peer network, while girls relied on familial networks. Lack of social networks and support, communication gap, and limited reach of health providers have majorly contributed to misinformation and misconceptions. Information through social media and online sources served as a key source of SRH knowledge among adolescents and unmarried youth, but concerns remained about the accuracy and reliability of the information accessed. Structural constraints such as stigma, mobility restrictions, and provider bias further marginalized unmarried youth-especially girls-from accessing reliable SRH services.
The study highlighted demand for SRH knowledge, source of knowledge, major concerns, and opportunities of AY in urban slums. A clear need for multi-faceted strategies targeting sexual health education, adolescent-responsive SRH services, and expanded digital outreach with verified content for this vulnerable populations are identified. However, targeted intervention through system level approaches for AY can be helpful for dispelling myths and providing accurate information.
Using qualitative data from urbanslums of two cities of Uttar Pradesh, this paper explores the limited knowledge about sexual and reproductive health, sources of information, contraceptive use, and engagement with the healthcare system among unmarried youth aged 15–24 years. While traditional norms may disapprove of premarital sex, physical intimacy among unmarried youth is increasing in some parts of India. The major sources of sexual and reproductive health knowledge were peers and sisters-in-laws for boys and girls respectively. However, the social network of boys was wider than that of girls. There is an increasing tide of information through online content in social media, which serves as a key source of knowledge among adolescents, but their accuracy and reliability is questionable. Comprehensive knowledge about contraception is limited, mostly aware of methods such as condoms and pills; however, in-depth knowledge is lacking. Healthcare worker outreach among the unmarried youth was minimal and calls for policy and program intervention.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-26">摘要</h3>
<p>Patients undergoing recurrent emergent hernia repairs may represent some of the most vulnerable patients in the healthcare system. However, this population has not been adequately characterized to date, limiting identification of opportunities for intervention.
We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study of Medicare beneficiaries who underwent an index emergent or urgent ventral hernia repair between 2011 and 2021. We performed a multivariable risk-adjusted Royston-Parmar survival analysis for cumulative recurrent emergent hernia repair incidence within 10 years, accounting for patient comorbidities, demographics, and repair characteristics. We assessed patient, provider, and community factors associated with an increased risk of recurrent emergent hernia repair. We used the Social Vulnerability Index, a publicly available score from the CDC reflecting 15 sociodemographic factors, to measure social risk.
Among 120,227 Medicare beneficiaries who underwent emergent hernia repair during the study period, the mean (SD) age was 71 (12) and 58% were female. At 10 years, the cumulative incidence of recurrent emergent hernia repair was 6.4% (95% CI 6.2-6.7). Median time to recurrent repair was 1.6 years [IQR 0.8-3.2]. Risk-adjusted factors associated with increased risk for recurrent emergent repair include female sex (10-year Hazard Ratio [HR] 1.58, 95% CI [1.24-2.02]), Hispanic ethnicity (10-year HR 1.19, 95% CI [1.01-1.41]), and patients in the highest quintile of social vulnerability (10-year HR 1.33, 95% CI [1.03-1.71]). Hernias repaired via open approach (10-year HR 1.44, 95% CI [1.03- 2.01) and at for-profit hospitals (10-year HR 1.16, 95% CI [1.06-1.26]) also experienced increased risk.
Female, Hispanic, and socially vulnerable patients are at increased risk of recurrent emergent hernia repairs, as well as patients receiving an open index repair and care at for-profit hospitals. Our study highlights opportunities for intervention, including consideration of index repair approach and populations that may benefit from closer follow-up and earlier elective intervention for hernia recurrence.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-27">摘要</h3>
<p>Tertiary students have been recognised as a high-risk population for psychological distress yet, in Australia, have been overlooked in population-level surveillance, health service provision and mental health policy. This study sought to explore trends in self-reported psychological distress and general mental health of tertiary students compared to their non-student working peers in Australia from 2007 to 2022- a timeframe which spans the pre-, mid-, and immediate-post-COVID time periods.
The Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey was used as a basis for this study. Focusing on participants aged 18 to 35 from survey waves spanning 2007 to 2022 (average n = 4415 per year), participants were categorised into three groups: working only, tertiary students and working, and tertiary students only. Psychological distress and general mental health were measured using the Kessler-10 scale and the Mental Health Inventory-5, respectively. Weighted regression models compared outcomes between students and non-students.
Psychological distress and poor mental health have risen among young Australians, with the sharpest increase since 2019. Tertiary students, especially those studying only, showed significantly higher distress and poorer mental health than working peers. Although adjusting for sociodemographic and socioeconomic covariates attenuated the associations, the higher distress levels in students persisted post-2019. Loneliness, long-term disabilities, and poor general health were correlates of poor mental health across all groups.
Findings highlight the need for targeted care models for tertiary students, including enhanced campus mental health support and screening services, financial support, social connection programs, and digital health solutions.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-28">摘要</h3>
<p>Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. As an age-related disease, its pathogenesis is shaped by several molecular hallmarks of aging, including impaired DNA repair and diminished stress resilience. The transcription factor NRF2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) is a master regulator of oxidative stress defense and cellular survival. While NRF2 activation is protective in aging tissues, it may also be exploited by cancer cells to promote tumor progression and therapy resistance. This study aims to evaluate whether NRF2 pathway activation predicts clinical outcomes in lung cancer, with potential implications for the use of NRF2-inducing compounds. We analyzed transcriptomic and survival data from 2167 lung cancer patients using the KM Plotter database. A validated 14-gene NRF2 activation signature was used to stratify tumors by NRF2 pathway activity. Associations with overall survival (OS), first progression (FP), and post-progression survival (PPS) were assessed using Cox regression models and Kaplan-Meier analysis. High NRF2 signature expression was significantly associated with poorer OS (HR = 1.59, p = 1.3E-9), FP (HR = 1.61, p = 2.6E-5), and PPS (HR = 1.6, p = 0.002). The negative prognostic effect was most pronounced in patients with adenocarcinoma, node-negative disease, and in female patients. These findings highlight the dual role of NRF2 in promoting stress resilience and enabling cancer cell survival. NRF2 activation is a predictor of poor clinical outcomes in lung cancer. Given the widespread use of NRF2-inducing compounds such as resveratrol and sulforaphane, these findings raise important concerns about their safety in individuals at risk for or living with cancer. Our results underscore the importance of context-specific evaluation of NRF2-targeted interventions and caution against the indiscriminate use of NRF2-activating agents in aging populations, particularly in individuals at risk for lung cancer.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-29">摘要</h3>
<p>The transition from adolescence to adulthood is characterized by changes and challenges for students, that can affect their mental well-being. Furthermore, mental disorders often emerge before the age of 24, underscoring the significance of addressing mental health during the college years. The study’s objective is to conduct a systematic review of the mental health of Italian university students, exploring the prevalence of psychopathological dimensions, identifying risk and protective factors, and investigating the impact on academic performance.
The initial search yielded 842 papers. After the screening process, a total of 27 studies were included (22,928 participants).
The prevalence of mental distress is notable: stress affects 72.6%, anxiety 61.8%, depression 41.6%, sleep disorders 63.9%, and suicide risk 6.1%.
Biological factors like chronic illness and family history increase the risk of psychological disorders. Psychological factors, including sexual orientation, play a role. Dysfunctional personality traits, adverse events, financial concerns, and the pandemic amplify distress.

<h3 id="摘要-30">摘要</h3>
<p>Survivors of breast cancer often face challenges in maintaining physical activity (PA) and reducing sedentary behavior (SB), which are crucial for recovery and long-term health. Digital behavior change interventions (DBCIs) have emerged as promising tools to address these behavioral targets.
This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the effectiveness of DBCIs in promoting PA and reducing SB among survivors of breast cancer.
A comprehensive search of 10 databases-PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Web of Science, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure database, the Wanfang database, the VIP database, and the Sedentary Behavior Research Database-was conducted to identify eligible randomized controlled trials that investigated the effectiveness of DBCIs in promoting PA and reducing SB among survivors of breast cancer. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool. Data synthesis was conducted via Review Manager. Owing to anticipated heterogeneity, a random-effects meta-analysis was used. The evidence quality was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach.
A total of 29 randomized controlled trials involving 2229 participants met the inclusion criteria. Most DBCIs were delivered at the interpersonal level using common behavior change techniques, including social support (unspecified), instruction on how to perform the behavior, demonstration of the behavior, action planning, and problem-solving. Meta-analysis revealed that DBCIs significantly improved shoulder range of motion across all planes (flexion: standardized mean difference [SMD]=2.08, 95% CI 1.14-3.01; P&lt;.001; extension: SMD=1.74, 95% CI 0.79-2.70; P&lt;.001; abduction: SMD=2.32, 95% CI 1.35-3.28; P&lt;.001; external rotation: SMD=2.29, 95% CI 0.96-3.62; P&lt;.001; internal rotation: SMD=2.98, 95% CI 1.08-4.87; P=.002; adduction: SMD=2.09, 95% CI 1.16-3.02; P&lt;.001), finger climbing wall height (SMD=1.65, 95% CI 1.35-1.95; P&lt;.001), upper-extremity function (SMD=-0.96, 95% CI -1.50 to -0.42; P&lt;.001), quality of life (SMD=1.83, 95% CI 0.44-3.22; P=.01), and reduced pain (SMD=-0.58, 95% CI -0.93 to -0.22; P=.002). However, no significant differences were found in steps (P=.69), time spent in light PA (P=.51), time spent in moderate to vigorous PA (P=.43), sedentary time (P=.18), or physical function (P=.71 or .11).
DBCIs effectively improve upper-body mobility, function, quality of life, and pain management in survivors of breast cancer. Future research should explore multilevel DBCIs specifically designed to address whole-body PA and SB reduction, with effectiveness evaluated through methodologically rigorous, large-scale trials.

<p>PurposeTo evaluate change in home radon testing after initiation of a public library radon detector lending program (LLP) in four rural counties; and describe the impact of LLP promotions on check-outs.DesignLongitudinal tracking of radon testing and description of LLP promotions.SettingFour rural Kentucky counties.Sample14,697 radon tests pre-LLP (charcoal-based test kits); 12,707 radon tests post-LLP (detector check-outs plus charcoal-based).InterventionLLP and promotional strategies including direct mail, radio, newsletters, social media, and in-library promotions and training.MeasuresRadon detector check-outs (03/2023-11/2024) comparing counties with and without LLP.AnalysisExamined change in radon testing pre- and post-LLP implementation using incidence rate ratios. Evaluated number of check-outs following promotions.ResultsThere was a 2.5-fold increase in the rate of radon testing in the four study counties (RR=2.5, 95% CI: 2.27-2.76; p&lt;.001), while the testing rate fell in non-study counties. Two study counties exceeded their check-out goals multiple months in a row following direct mail campaigns. Social media, in-library signage, and billboards were reported most effective at promoting the program. The proportion of county-level renter-occupied housing fluctuated, potentially affecting differences in library check outs.ConclusionLLPs show promise in maximizing access to population-based radon testing. Mailing postcards to residents had a sustained impact on detector check-outs over 3-5 months in some counties.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-32">摘要</h3>
<p>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: SCORe of Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (SCORTEN) and ABCD-10 have been developed as scoring systems for predicting mortality associated with Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). These scores were developed based on a small number of patients; hence, their generalizability requires further exploration. The present study used three algorithms, including a machine learning method, to construct a mortality prediction model for SJS/TEN and to identify new candidate predictors of mortality from severe drug eruptions.
Data from 5966 patients with SJS or TEN were extracted from the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report Database. A mortality prediction model was then constructed using stepwise regression, L1 regularized-logistic regression, and random forests based on the patient characteristics (e.g., age, sex, primary disease, adverse events, drug classification, route of administration) and outcomes (death).
The mortality prediction models for SJS/TEN identified sex (men), primary disease (hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, renal dysfunction, and malignant tumors), adverse events (renal dysfunction, liver dysfunction, respiratory dysfunction, bacteremia/sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome, shock, and multiple organ failure), number of concomitant drugs, and route of administration (injection) as common factors associated with mortality.
Our findings showed that sex, hyperlipidemia as the primary disease, number of concomitant drugs, use of antipyretic analgesics, and route of administration may be considered as predictors of mortality in patients with SJS/TEN. The external validity of these factors needs to be examined in the future.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-33">摘要</h3>
<p>The aim of implementation research is to transfer evidence-based interventions from research into practice. Successful transfer requires acceptance of the interventions by users and implementers. Research processes are increasingly focussing on participatory approaches in which various stakeholders are involved in research and implementation, thereby increasing the acceptability of interventions. Depending on the intervention, participation may draw from users, research, care providers or policy and funding bodies. Citizens and patients play a crucial role in participatory processes. Participatory implementation research is a collaborative approach that combines implementation research with the co-creation of knowledge by systematically involving participants in the research process and beyond. In this way, user-centred, tailor-made, lifeworld-oriented interventions in health promotion and healthcare can be scientifically developed under real-life conditions and permanently transferred into real-world practice. This review article examines the status of participatory implementation research in Germany and outlines the concepts and framework of participatory implementation research. To this end, projects from the fields of patient care, health promotion and the community setting are described. Two examples of the long-term participation of citizens of a neighbourhood in research conducted in the urban district laboratories in Bochum and Hamburg show how continuous participation and co-creation in implementation research for prevention, health promotion and health care can succeed.An English full-text version of this article is available at SpingerLink as Supplementary Information.
Ziel der Implementierungsforschung ist es evidenzbasierte Interventionen aus der Wissenschaft in die Praxis zu transferieren. Für einen erfolgreichen Transfer braucht es die Akzeptanz der Interventionen durch die Nutzenden und Umsetzenden. In Forschungsprozessen finden vermehrt partizipative Ansätze Berücksichtigung, in welchen verschiedene Akteur:innen an der Forschung und Implementierung beteiligt werden und damit die Akzeptanz von Maßnahmen erhöht wird. Partizipierende kommen je nach Intervention aus den Bereichen der Nutzenden, Wissenschaft, Versorgung, Politik oder Finanzierung. Eine besondere Rolle nehmen in partizipativen Prozessen die Bürger:innen und Patient:innen ein. Die partizipative Implementierungsforschung ist ein kollaborativer Ansatz, der die Implementierungsforschung mit der Ko-Kreation von Wissen verbindet, indem die Beteiligten systematisch in den Forschungsprozess und darüber hinaus eingebunden werden. Somit lassen sich nutzer:innenorientierte, passgenaue, lebensweltorientierte Interventionen der Gesundheitsförderung und der Gesundheitsversorgung wissenschaftlich unter Realbedingungen entwickeln und dauerhaft in die Praxis überführen. Dieser Übersichtsartikel beleuchtet den Stand der partizipativen Implementierungsforschung in Deutschland und geht auf Konzepte und Rahmenbedingungen der partizipativen Implementierungsforschung ein. Dafür werden Projekte aus den Bereichen Patientenversorgung, Gesundheitsförderung und dem Setting Kommune beschrieben. Zwei Beispiele der langfristigen Beteiligung von Bürger:innen eines Stadtteils an Forschung in den Stadtteillaboren Bochum und Hamburg zeigen, wie eine kontinuierliche Partizipation und Ko-Kreation in der Implementierungsforschung im Bereich der Prävention, Gesundheitsförderung und Gesundheitsversorgunggelingen kann.Eine englische Übersetzung des Artikels steht im Online-Material zur Verfügung.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-34">摘要</h3>
<p>Amyloid fibril formation by proteins is implicated in numerous human diseases, yet few treatments exist in part due to the lack of robust screening methods for amyloid inhibitors. Here, we demonstrate a novel mass spectrometry (MS) assay for high-throughput screening of amyloid inhibitors, based on measuring the extent of protein labeling during protein aggregation. Amyloid formation decreases covalent labeling (CL) extents, while the presence of an inhibitor restores the extent of labeling, providing a means of identifying inhibitors. Using two different labeling reagents, α,β-unsaturated carbonyl (ABUC) and diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC), and insulin and β2-microglobulin (β2m) as model amyloid proteins, we show that the CL-MS assay can probe protein amyloid formation and its inhibition by a wide range of compounds, with validation achieved by comparisons to traditional fluorescence and light scattering techniques. In proof-of-concept screens, several new inhibitors are identified for both proteins and further verified for their ability to fully prevent aggregation. Overall, our CL-MS assay offers fewer false positives than conventional methods and is compatible with high-throughput screening, achieving rates of &gt;10 compounds per minute using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-MS as a readout.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-35">摘要</h3>
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), trigger finger (TF), Dupuytren’s disease (DD) and de Quervain tenosynovitis (DQT) are musculoskeletal disorders that affect hand abilities. Previous studies have suggested inconsistent results on their association. This study aims to determine the cause-and-effect relationship between RA and other four hand disorders.
We collected summary-level statistics for RA, CTS, TF, DD, and DQT from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). A univariable Mendelian randomization (UVMR) analysis was conducted to investigate the cause-and-effect relationship between RA and other hand conditions. Furthermore, a multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) analysis was conducted to evaluate the influence of confounding variables such as glycemia, obesity, and lifestyle factors on this causal association. The robustness of our findings is assessed by a series of sensitivity analyses at the end.
The inverse variance-weighted method in UVMR revealed that genetically predicted RA was positively associated with risks of CTS (OR = 04, 95% CI 1.01-1.07, P = 4.97E-03), TF (OR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.06-1.20, P = 8.97E-05), and DQT (OR = 1.11, 95% CI 1.02-1.21, P = 0.019), but not linked with DD (OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.96-1.07, P = 0.61). After adjusting for glycemia, obesity, and lifestyle factors in the MVMR analyses, the causal effects of RA on increased risks of CTS and TF remained significant. Leave-one-out analyses demonstrated that no individual single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) significantly impacted RA’s overall causal effect estimates on CTS and TF.
Our results indicate that RA is an independent genetic factor contributing to CTS and TF, but not to DQT or DD. This finding supports recommendations aimed at preventing the occurrence of CTS and TF in patients with RA. However, further high-quality studies are needed to validate this association and to determine its general applicability.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-36">摘要</h3>
<p>To determine the age-specific distribution of serum calcium levels in the Xing’an League population and assess the applicability of current national standards.
Data were collected from 3000 healthy individuals across different age groups in the Xing’an League, stratified by sex and age. Serum calcium levels were measured, and statistical methods were used to analyse sex- and age-related differences. The relevance of the current Chinese Health Industry Standard reference intervals for serum calcium was evaluated, and age-related trends were assessed.
Significant differences in serum calcium levels were found between sexes and across age groups. The current national reference intervals did not adequately capture the age- and region-specific characteristics of serum calcium levels in the Xing’an League population, highlighting the need for localized evaluation criteria.
The study demonstrates the impact of sex and age on serum calcium levels and emphasises the importance of recognising regional variations. The findings provide a scientific basis for enhancing disease prevention and developing personalised treatment strategies to address regional disparities in clinical practice.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-37">摘要</h3>
<p>The global burden and trend of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) in postmenopausal women (PMW) remain unclear.
Using the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 data, this study assessed the prevalence and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis (OA), low back pain (LBP), neck pain (NP), gout, and other musculoskeletal conditions (OMSKDs) from 1990 to 2021. Bayesian Age-Period-Cohort (BAPC) models projected trends to 2045. Health inequalities were analyzed using the Slope Index of Inequality (SII) and the Concentration Index, with decomposition methods identifying the drivers of burden changes.
From 1990 to 2021, the age-standardized prevalence and DALYs rates have significantly increased among PMW, with OA and LBP being the primary contributors to this burden. These increases were primarily driven by population growth. Specifically, RA, OA, and gout accounted for more than 50% of the total burden in women across all age groups, with RA burden being 1.2 times higher than that in premenopausal women, OA 3.1 times higher, and gout 2.9 times higher. Notably, in PMW, the burden of gout was 74%. The burden of gout is strongly correlated with the Socio-Demographic Index (SDI), particularly in high-income regions, such as North America, where the United States exhibits the highest DALYs rates. Furthermore, projections indicate that by 2045, the global burden of MSDs could double, with OA potentially affecting nearly 50% of the PMW.
From 1990 to 2021, the global burden of MSDs among PMW has risen significantly, with notable regional disparities underscoring the critical need for tailored preventive strategies to alleviate the worldwide impact of these conditions.</p>

<p>To investigate the risk factors and prognosis of acute kidney injury (AKI) in elderly patients after surgery based on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV).
A retrospective analysis was conducted using MIMIC-IV data pertaining to aged postoperative patients. By logistic regression analysis models, Kaplan-Meier survival curve and Cox proportional hazards regression model. To evaluate the independent risk variables and prognosis of postoperative AKI in elderly patients.
A total of 1784 elderly patients who met the inclusion criteria were analyzed. Among them, 1423 developed AKI after surgery. The development of AKI was significantly associated with the use of vasoactive drugs, invasive mechanical ventilation, traumatic surgical procedures, and elevated serum creatinine (Scr) levels within 24 h of admission. Cardiac surgery was also highly correlated with postoperative AKI. Factors associated with 28-day mortality in elderly patients with AKI included age ≥ 75 years, higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, presence of cerebrovascular disease (CVD), invasive ventilation, neurosurgical procedures, and traumatic surgical procedures.
Age, Gender, Intervention measures and laboratory indicators can affect the incidence and prognosis of elderly patients’ postoperative AKI. Early identification and timely intervention in patients with these high-risk factors are of practical significance in preventing the occurrence and progression of AKI.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-39">摘要</h3>
<p>Emergency Medical Services (EMS) play a critical role as the initial point of contact for patients with trauma injuries, where making timely and accurate dispatch decisions is crucial for determining the speed and effectiveness of the response. Assessing injury severity and the appropriate EMS resources needed based on audio medical emergency number calls (e.g. 999/911/112) alone presents challenges. The prevalence of smartphones among the UK population offers a unique opportunity by enabling callers to send live video feeds to Emergency Operations Centres. This study explores the use of video livestreaming in emergency dispatch of prehospital enhanced care teams to determine how and why it impacts decision-making and situational awareness during trauma incidents and whether this varies by patient/caller, incident or dispatcher characteristics.
A multimethod qualitative observational study was undertaken comprising 200 h of non-participant ethnographic observation of the use of video livestreaming in routine practice, and 14 semi-structured interviews with staff within two critical care services in London, UK who used the technology. Data collection and analysis were underpinned by naturalistic decision-making models that emphasise the role of situational awareness. Data were analysed and triangulated using the framework method.
We identified three phases in the decision-making process for use of video livestreaming in emergency dispatch: (i) Evaluation and Determination, (ii) Integration and Observation, and (iii) Resolution and Response. Phase 1 addresses why video livestreaming is used and the patient/caller, incident and dispatcher characteristics and identifying primary drivers and barriers. Phase 2 explores how livestreaming impacts situational awareness, focusing on visual cues such as clinical indicators, mechanisms of injury, and environmental factors. Phase 3 examines the impact on dispatch decision-making and immediate care advice. An overarching theme emphasises the role of dispatchers’ clinical experience and expertise in using video livestreaming effectively.
Video livestreaming has the potential to impact situational awareness and decision-making in emergency dispatch, as reported by participants and observed during the study, particularly in response to complex and ambiguous trauma scenarios. The technology’s effectiveness depends on dispatcher expertise, caller characteristics, and incident complexity. Further research is needed to evaluate its use across different EMS contexts.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-40">摘要</h3>
<p>With the rapid development of industry and agriculture, the ecological and health impacts of nickel (Ni2+) have gained increasing attention. While previous experimental studies have identified factors influencing Ni2+ adsorption behavior in soils, their nonlinear relationships and interactive effects remain underexplored. Through combining machine learning (CatBoost/XGBoost) models with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), this study analyzed 662 experimental datasets to reveal these nonlinear interactions between factors that affect the adsorption behavior of Ni2+ in soil. The modeling results demonstrated CatBoost’s superior performance over XGBoost (test R2 = 0.85 vs 0.83). Both feature importance analysis from the model and SHAP values identified the initial Ni2+ concentration (C0) as the most critical factor, followed by ionic strength (IS), solid-to-liquid ratio (SL), clay content, and cation exchange capacity (CEC). SHAP dependence plots revealed a nonlinear SL effect that maximum adsorption occurred at low SL ratios with subsequent fluctuations attributable to ionic competition and pore accessibility constraints. Notably, SHAP interaction analysis uncovered a key finding which C0 exhibited synergistic interactions with both CEC and clay content to enhance Ni2+ immobilization, whereas elevated IS substantially diminished these cooperative effects. This work quantitatively characterizes multifactorial coupling in Ni2+ adsorption processes, advancing theoretical foundations for risk assessment while informing targeted remediation strategies and enhancing mechanistic understanding of heavy metal interactions in soil systems.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-41">摘要</h3>
<p>Herbicides are agrochemicals used for the eradication of weeds in agriculture. Farmers worldwide recognize paraquat-based herbicides for their high effectiveness against different weeds. Previous research indicates that the extensive application of herbicides may endanger environmental, animal, and human health due to their toxicity. Specifically, herbicides have been associated with carcinogenic effects. Several molecular and cellular mechanisms have been linked to the carcinogenicity of herbicides, including the induction of DNA damage and/or oxidative stress through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Researchers have linked several molecular and cellular mechanisms to the carcinogenicity of herbicides, which would result in the proliferation, survival, and invasion of cancerous cells. Particularly, paraquat-based herbicides can disrupt the cellular redox balance, which makes them extremely toxic to animals and humans. Although the World Health Organization’s (WHO) International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has not evaluated the carcinogenicity of paraquat to date, several countries have banned its use due to its association with a high mortality rate from self-poisoning incidents. Our review seeks to provide a comprehensive panorama of the carcinogenic effects of paraquat-based herbicides in animals and humans, encompassing studies on environmental persistence, molecular and cellular mechanisms of toxicity, and epidemiological research on paraquat’s association with carcinogenesis.</p>

<p>Experts communicating reliable and timely information are critical during public health crises. While assessments of human health crisis communication and preparedness have received attention, population animal welfare assessments are limited. This study assessed animal care worker (ACW) survey responses to identify factors potentially valuable for preparedness and intervention design for future crises that affect companion animals.
Our team took a subset of data from a US survey (conducted between July and October 2020) to investigate small animal veterinary (SAV; N = 1209) and animal shelter, rescue and control (SRC; N = 132) COVID-19 pandemic concerns pertinent to animal welfare, self-perceived knowledge of pandemic impacts, and update frequency and information sources.
Compared with SAV workers, SRC workers more often reported frequent communication (p &lt; 0.001), self-perceived expert knowledge (p = 0.012) and having welfare concerns (p = 0.012). The same was true for clinical SRC workers, more so than non-clinical SRC. Frequent updates correlated with greater self-perceived knowledge (p &lt; 0.001). Information sources were primarily animal welfare focused for SRC workers and veterinary health focused for SAV.
Community socioeconomic status and update contents are unknown. Furthermore, sample diversity was low, which may limit the generalisability of the findings.
There is a potential need for increased, more harmonised crisis communication from leading public and animal health entities to better support SAV and clinical SRC workers.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-43">摘要</h3>
<p>Environmental pollutants, such as zearalenone (ZEA), a mycotoxin from Fusarium graminearum that contaminates cereal crops and animal feed, significantly threaten reproductive health. The main toxicity mechanism of ZEA involves triggering oxidative stress and apoptosis. Zinc (Zn), a critical antioxidant for reproductive health, may counteract ZEA toxicity, but its mechanism of action remains unclear. The objective of the study was to investigate the alleviating effects of Zn supplementation against ZEA-induced testicular toxicity. We combined network toxicology and animal experiments to evaluate Zn’s efficacy. Male Kunming mice were divided into Control, ZEA (2 mg/kg), Zn (20 mg/kg) and ZEA + Zn (10/20/40 mg/kg) groups and treated for 28 days. The results revealed that ZEA exhibited marked reductions in sperm quality, accompanied by structural testicular injury to the testis. ZEA diminishes the activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), while simultaneously increasing the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), which results in oxidative stress. ZEA down-regulates serum levels of testosterone (T), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and impairs steroidogenesis. Significant elevations in ROS levels and apoptotic protein expression were observed in the testicular tissue of the ZEA group. ZEA significantly decreased both the mRNA and protein expression levels of Sirt3 and Foxo3, as well as their immunofluorescence intensity. Zn significantly increased sperm quality, improved testicular morphology, increased Sirt3 and Foxo3 levels, reduced ROS, normalized antioxidant capacity, improved apoptosis, and restored serum hormone levels. These findings emphasize the reproductive risks associated with ZEA, while also highlighting Zn as a possible candidate for developing alleviating effects against mycotoxin-induced reproductive toxicity.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-44">摘要</h3>
<p>Research into how pollution and climate change-induced food insecurity affect adolescents’ mental health in Afghanistan is still in its infancy. This study analyses the association between pollution exposure, climate change-induced food insecurity and, depressive symptoms among adolescents in Afghanistan.
A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1416 adolescents and their 1416 parents and/or caregivers in seven provinces of Afghanistan. Exposure to pollution and climate change-induced food insecurity are the explanatory variables of interest. Mental health was measured by the occurrence of depression. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used for estimation.
The multivariate logistic regression results revealed that adolescents exposed to pollution were 2.66 times more likely to exhibit depressive symptoms (OR = 2.66; p &lt; 0.001  ), and the effects were significant for both boys and girls. Adolescents experiencing climate change (drought and floods) induced food insecurity were 1.39 times more likely to exhibit depressive symptoms (OR = 1.30; p &lt; 0.05  ). In addition, the study found that the effects of drought and flood induced food insecurity on mental health were pronounced among girls than boys.
Exposure to pollution and climate change-induced food insecurity were associated with depressive symptoms among adolescents. The public, private sector, and international organizations should promote pollution, drought, and flood mitigation strategies, as these environmental factors may contribute to mental health challenges among adolescents. There is need for interventions that specifically target female adolescents given their vulnerabilities to climate change-induced food insecurity. There is scope to integrate mental health services, with food security, pollution and climate mitigation interventions in Afghanistan. Policymakers should focus on regular community-based mental health screening programs, training local mental health professionals, and educating adolescents about the symptoms of depression.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-45">摘要</h3>
<p>Microplastics and nanoplastics are ubiquitous environmental pollutants that contaminate air, food and water supplies, resulting in widespread human exposure and potential health risks. Varying concentrations of particulate plastics have been identified in human tissues and body fluids, including the heart, kidney, liver, brain, blood and urine. Studies in animal models and human cells have reported that particulate plastics can induce oxidative stress, cell death and inflammation as well as disrupt metabolism and immune function. They have also been shown to have toxic effects on kidney and cardiovascular cells, which are exacerbated by the presence of other environmental contaminants such as heavy metals. Patients with kidney failure might be at risk of increased exposure to particulate plastics during dialysis. Furthermore, clinical evidence suggests that particulate plastic exposure is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Approaches to mitigating such exposure include degradation via abiotic and biotic processes, improved waste management and water filtration approaches and use of alternative materials. Further research into the fate, toxicity and health consequences of particulate plastics is imperative to inform strategies to address this escalating environmental and health concern.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-46">摘要</h3>
<p>In the Exposures in the Peace River Valley (EXPERIVA) study, pregnant individuals living in a region of natural gas exploitation had higher biological concentrations of certain trace elements, including strontium (Sr), than the general population. However, sources remained unidentified.
To measure urinary 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratio in EXPERIVA participants, assess its reliability, and explore how its variance fluctuates based on Sr concentrations in biological (urine, hair, nails) and environmental (tap water) samples, as well as the density/proximity of unconventional oil and gas wells around participants’ residence.
Participants provided urine daily over seven consecutive days. We measured 87Sr/86Sr in each urine sample from 7 participants and in pooled daily samples for all 75 participants. We used serial measurements to determine the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). We calculated the density/proximity of unconventional oil and gas wells around participants’ homes using inverse distance weighting (IDW). We assessed the variance of urinary 87Sr/86Sr based on Sr concentrations in biological/environmental samples and IDW through visual inspection and Levene’s test. We also performed unsupervised clustering to explore whether certain characteristics of the participants may be associated with a specific 87Sr/86Sr signature.
Urinary 87Sr/86Sr ranged from 0.70798 to 0.71437. The ICC was 0.797 (95% CI: 0.574-0.953), indicating moderate to excellent reliability. Increasing Sr concentrations in hair were marginally associated with a decrease in urinary 87Sr/86Sr variance (p = 0.066). A similar but less consistent association was observed with increasing IDW. We observed no association between Sr concentrations in water and variance in urinary 87Sr/86Sr. No clear pattern was found using unsupervised clustering.
To our knowledge, this study is the first to explore the use of urinary 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios to investigate sources of Sr exposure. Results are consistent with the hypothesis that a predominant source contributes to Sr exposure in most exposed EXPERIVA participants, but the contribution of unconventional oil and gas wells around participants’ residences remains unclear. Findings should be considered as exploratory given the many limitations of this study. Our effort will hopefully benefit future studies aimed at identifying the sources of exposure in human populations.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-47">摘要</h3>
<p>Environmental stressors have exacerbated the collapse of marine ecosystems during mass extinctions. However, the survival strategies of marine species during mass extinctions remain unclear. Here, we investigated morphological evolution of brachiopods across the Permian-Triassic mass extinction (PTME) using a database of 3,225 specimens representing 1,061 species and foraminifera across the PTME and early Toarcian oceanic anoxic event (T-OAE) using a database of 757 specimens representing 12 species. We found a significant reduction in the number and proportion (plicae length/shell length) of shell plicae of brachiopods (36.4% and 60.0%, respectively) across the PTME and a significant decrease in the shell thickness of foraminifera (18.9% and 42.4% across the PTME and 36.9-61.8% across the T-OAE). We calculated that these adaptive strategies could reduce the energetic costs of calcification by more than half for brachiopods across the PTME, and by ~20-62% for foraminifera across the PTME and T-OAE, to compensate for the elevated cost of calcification due to environmental and ecological pressures. We propose that simplification of morphological features, such as reduced shell ornamentation and shell thinning, serves as a potential economic strategy for calcifying organisms to cope with extinction events by reducing energy demands, but further studies with a broader range of taxa and extinction events are needed to confirm the generality of this bioenergetic strategy.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-48">摘要</h3>
<p>This study assessed the early effects of ozoralizumab (OZR) 30 mg in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX-IR), drawing on OHZORA trial data for efficacy and safety insights.
The study included 141 patients with RA from the OHZORA trial, initiated on OZR 30 mg. The primary measure was the rate of achieving low disease activity (LDA) by the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) 3 days post-OZR initiation. Growth mixture modelling (GMM) of CDAI trajectories was performed to enable a more detailed analysis of the impact of OZR on disease activity improvement.
The retention rate of OZR up to 52 weeks was 87.9% (n=124). The LDA achievement rate on the third day of OZR introduction was 12.8% (n=18), and by week 52, 70.9% (n=100) had improved to LDA. Three distinct groups were identified using GMM: one group (n=78) reached LDA within 4 weeks of OZR initiation and maintained LDA up to week 52. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that both low baseline C-reactive protein (CRP) and low CDAI were independently associated with group membership.
OZR 30 mg demonstrated both immediate and sustained efficacy in MTX-IR patients with RA. Multivariate analysis suggested that both baseline inflammation and disease activity-represented by CRP and CDAI-may independently influence treatment response. However, residual confounding due to baseline disease activity cannot be completely excluded, and this remains a limitation of the present study.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-49">摘要</h3>
<p>The high prevalence of mental health issues (MHI) among employees poses significant societal challenges. However, little is known about factors that influence their ability to remain employed, maintain productivity, and thrive at work.
This study examines differences in occupational health outcomes (burnout, work engagement, and work ability) between employees with and without MHI and the applicability of the Job Demands-Resources model (including job demands, job resources as psychosocial working conditions and sense of coherence (SOC) as a personal resource) among employees with MHI, while particularly controlling for disease-specific factors.
Pooled data from two measurement waves were analyzed, including employees with current MHI (N = 92) and those without MHI (N = 877) from German-speaking countries. Mixed-effects models examined relationships between sociodemographic, disease-specific factors, psychosocial working conditions, SOC, and occupational health outcomes.
Employees with MHI showed lower occupational health levels (higher burnout, reduced work ability) than those without. Among employees with MHI, SOC and job resources were significantly associated with all occupational health outcomes, while job demands primarily predicted burnout. Sickness absence correlated negatively with both burnout and work ability. The association between SOC and work ability was stronger for employees with MHI than for those without.
Job resources and SOC play a role for occupational health in employees with MHI. Targeted interventions to strengthen these resources should be prioritized.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-51">摘要</h3>
<p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has recently emerged as a significant, global public health threat, and the gut microbiota are now recognized as playing a crucial role in the pathogenesis and progression of CKD. In this study, we investigated the correlation between differential gut microbiota and renal function impairment by analyzing the structure, diversity, and other characteristics of the gut microbiota in patients with CKD. Our findings indicated that CKD patients exhibit decreased species diversity and evenness in their gut microbiota compared to healthy individuals, with notable differences in community composition between the groups. Among them, p_Actinobacteriota, p_Cyanobacteria, g_Faecalibacterium, g_Agathobacter, g_Roseburia, and g_Actinomyces were significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.05), while p_Acidobacteriota, g_Blautia, and g_Candidatus-Solibacter were significantly increased in CKD (p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, functional prediction results suggested that the differential pathways primarily involved metabolic pathways, including Carbohydrate Metabolism, Glycan Biosynthesis and Metabolism, Biosynthesis of Other Secondary Metabolites, Metabolism of Other Amino Acids, and pathways related to Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases. Meanwhile, correlation studies revealed a significant negative correlation between g_Actinomyces and serum uric acid levels (r = -0.426, p = 0.038), and a significant positive correlation between g_C. Solibacter and serum uric acid levels (r = 0.461, p = 0.023). This study highlights the significant differences in the composition and species abundance of gut microbiota between CKD patients and healthy individuals, while also demonstrating that the abundances of g_Actinomyces and g_C. Solibacter are correlated with serum uric acid levels, an indicator of renal function impairment.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-52">摘要</h3>
<p>Effective physical activity promotion requires a comprehensive understanding of physical activity across work, household, travel, and recreation domains. Although previous studies have assessed the relative contributions of each domain to total physical activity using averages, the distribution among diverse individuals remains unclear. We aimed to develop a visualization approach to assess the distribution of the relative contributions of each domain to physical activity.
We used nationally representative data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2017-2018 for the United States and 2020 Sasakawa Sports Foundation National Sports-Life Survey for Japan; both utilized the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire. We calculated each domain’s relative contribution to total physical activity and created histograms of ternary plots.
The distribution of each domain’s relative contributions to total physical activity demonstrated that most participants from the United States and Japan concentrated their activity in 1 or 2 domains. However, clusters of domain composition differed between the 2 countries. In the United States, work/household contributions were highest (50.6%), with fewer individuals having high travel contributions. In Japan, travel contributed the most (41.7%), with many clusters showing low work/household contributions. The average total moderate and vigorous physical activity in both countries was higher among those with greater work/household contributions.
Our novel visualization approach demonstrated that most participants concentrate their physical activity in 1 or 2 domains. Given the diverse ways to meet physical activity guidelines, it is crucial to adopt a systems approach that considers each domain, from enhancing active transportation to promoting recreational physical activity.</p>

<p>To develop a detection system for Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) and provide a reference for clinical prevention and control of nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae. The KPC resistance gene was amplified by PCR. Guided by crRNA, Cas12a specifically identified the resistance gene and activated its trans-cleavage activity. In the detection system, a fluorescence probe was cleaved by activated Cas12a, and the fluorescence signal was measured using a microplate reader. Under optimized conditions, the fluorescence signal appeared within 12 min, peaked at 40 min and completed detection within 60 min. sensitivity: 91.2%, specificity: 84.1%, detection limit: 0.01 ng/μl. The samples were examined by fluorescence-CRISPR Cas12a and PCR. The coincidence rate was 85.9%, Kappa value was 0.8. The ROC curve analysis revealed an AUC of 0.916, with an optimal cutoff value of 1.55, sensitivity of 91.2%, and specificity of 84.1%. The CRISPR Cas12a detection of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP) demonstrates high sensitivity, specificity, and broad applicability. This method requires standard molecular biology equipment but does not rely on sequencing-based platforms.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-54">摘要</h3>
<p>Mucosal surfaces are dynamic immunological interfaces that play a critical role in maintaining host defense and microbial homeostasis. Disruptions in the interaction between the mucosal immune system and its commensal microbiota have been associated with the onset of several diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, asthma, and bacterial vaginosis. This review examines recent advances in nanoparticle (NP)-based strategies aimed at modulating mucosal immunity and restructuring microbial communities. It highlights how organic and inorganic NPs such as polysaccharide-based carriers, lipid NPs, and metallic nanomaterials enhance the delivery and stability of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics, and facilitate targeted immunomodulation across gastrointestinal, respiratory, and female reproductive mucosal tissues. NP-based strategies are particularly emphasized for their ability to penetrate mucus barriers, facilitate microbial colonization, modulate cytokine activity, and enhance the restoration of epithelial barrier function. Disease-specific applications, including NP-based therapies for colitis, respiratory inflammation, and vaginal dysbiosis, are also discussed. In addition, this review outlines current challenges related to biosafety, targeting specificity, and clinical translation, and suggests future directions for research. Altogether, NP platforms offer a promising avenue for the precise modulation of mucosal immunity and microbiota, with significant potential in the prevention and treatment of mucosal-associated diseases.</p>

<p>Descriptions of how centers implement standardized screening for pain and how pain affects activities among adults with cerebral palsy (CP) are lacking.
Improve screening for pain in adults with CP across three centers and examine factors associated with pain that affect activities.
Using the quality improvement (QI) infrastructure of the Cerebral Palsy Research Network (CPRN), we implemented interventions to improve screening at clinic visits for pain that affects activities for adults with CP. Four physicians from three CPRN centers in the United States performed interventions. To track progress, we collected visit data cross sectionally every two weeks. Descriptive statistics, analysis of variance, and logistic regression evaluated relationships in a cohort of visits after screening practices had been established.
Screening improved from 42 % at baseline to over 90 %. After three months of sustained screening, we assessed 423 visits. Pain was reported at 185/423 (44 %) of visits. 100/185 (54 %) reported pain that affected activities. Increasing age, female gender, and greater motor function were associated with pain (p &lt; 0.001) and pain that affects activities (p &lt; 0.01). Females reported pain 3.4 times and pain that affects activity 2.2 times more than males.
QI methodology was successful at improving screening for pain that affects activities in adults with CP. Lower rates of pain were found (44 %) than previous reports, with similar findings about pain affecting activities and associated characteristics. Next steps should include continued screening with improvement in differentiating proxy vs self-report and including other domains of pain important to guide care.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-56">摘要</h3>
<p>This study compared levels of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in adults with and without chronic diseases or multimorbidity, acknowledging sociodemographic factors.
A cross-sectional analysis was conducted with data from 27,890 participants (52% women), aged 50-64, from the Swedish CArdioPulmonary bioImage Study cohort. Over 1500 chronic diseases were included and categorized into chronic disease and multimorbidity groups. Chronic diseases were retrieved from national registries, using International Classification of Disease codes. PA and SB were measured with a triaxial hip-worn accelerometer, over 7 consecutive days. General linear models were used to calculate estimated means for daily time spent in light-intensity PA (LIPA), moderate- to vigorous-intensity PA and SB.
Time spent in LIPA, moderate- to vigorous-intensity PA, and SB did not differ between individuals in a chronic disease group and individuals without chronic diseases. Individuals living with any multimorbidity spent less time in moderate- to vigorous-intensity PA than participants without chronic diseases. Individuals living with 4 or more chronic diseases spent more time sedentary than individuals without chronic diseases. Women spent more time in LIPA and less time in SB than men, regardless of chronic disease or multimorbidity. Individuals with less education spent more time in LIPA and less time in SB than individuals with more education, regardless of chronic disease or multimorbidity.
When using an extensive set of chronic diseases, marginal differences in PA and SB were seen between individuals living with and without chronic diseases. PA and SB seem to significantly differ by sex and education, rather than living with chronic disease.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-57">摘要</h3>
<p>Stress and sedentary lifestyles negatively impact the physical fitness of overweight and obese female university students. Physical activity has been shown to promote psychological as well as physical wellness. However, the effects of Surya Namaskar (SN) yoga on stress and physical fitness remain unclear.
This study aimed to compare the physical fitness, anthropometric measures, and perceived stress between the SN yoga training program group and the control group.
In a randomized controlled study, 44 overweight and obese female university students participated. For 8 weeks, the exercise group received training in SN yoga, whereas the control group was not permitted to participate in any form of exercise. At baseline and after 8 weeks of training, all participants completed the Thai Perceived Stress Scale-10 (T-PSS-10), and assessed the body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio, body fat percentage, maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max), and muscle strength and flexibility. We used the dependent t-test or Wilcoxon sign rank test to examine the differences between the T-PSS-10 and physical fitness within each group. The statistical differences of all parameters between the two groups were compared using an independent t-test or a Mann-Whitney U test. A p- value &lt; 0 . 05 was considered statistically significant.
Compared to the baseline, the SN yoga group’s post-training period had a significant increase ( p &lt; 0 . 05 ) in forward back flexibility, hand grip strength, leg strength, and VO2max, while a significant decrease ( p &lt; 0 . 05 ) in T-PSS-10 scores and BMI. In addition, we found a significant difference between the both groups in forward back flexibility and T-PSS-10 scores in the post-training period ( p = 0 . 015 and p = 0 . 009 , respectively).
This study’s findings demonstrated that SN yoga is a useful exercise for enhancing overweight and obese female university students’ perceived stress scales and physical fitness.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-58">摘要</h3>
<p>Cervical spine involvement remains one of the more serious complications of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Several factors interfere with the occurrence of this complication. The aim of this work was to identify the risk factors associated with cervical involvement, specifying the contribution of MRI in screening for rheumatoid cervical spine and discussing the value of standard X-rays.
A cross-sectional study included 100 patients with RA who underwent both standard radiography and MRI of the cervical spine. Clinical, paraclinical and therapeutic data were collected.
Cervical pain was the predominant functional sign. It was mechanical in 44% of cases and inflammatory in 29%. Physical signs revealed on clinical examination included: pain on cervical spine mobilisation (49%), cervical stiffness (37%) and abnormal neurological examination in 3% of cases. Standard radiographs revealed C1-C2 instability in 52% of cases: vertical displacement (28%), rotatory displacement (22%), anterior displacement (19%) and lateral displacement (1%). MRI confirmed the presence of the following types of atlantoaxial subluxation: vertical (34%) and anterior subluxation (27%). Other lesions were identified on MRI: synovial thickening (31%) with contrast enhancement (17%), hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI; 6%) and odontoid erosion (16%). Cervico-Medullar Angle (CMA) was pathological (CMA &lt; 135°) in 3% of patients. A study of the correlation between patient-related parameters, RA-related parameters, cervical symptomatology-related parameters and rheumatoid C1-C2 involvement concluded that age was positively correlated with C1-C2 instability (p = 0.036), as was the presence of Rheumatoid Factor (RF) (p = 0.038), coxitis (p = 0.042) and dry eye syndrome (p = 0.039). Cervical spine stiffness was positively correlated with C1-C2 instability (p = 0.01). The presence of inflammatory cervical pain (p = 0), and painful mobilisation on examination (p = 0.03) were correlated with C1-C2 synovitis.
The ‘RA and cervical spine’ entity is associated with phenotypes of seropositive, destructive RA, with peripheral synovitis and systemic manifestations. Systematic clinical and radiological screening for this condition is essential to preserve functional prognosis. Diffusion imaging of the craniocervical region appears to be a valuable adjunct for the quantitative assessment of synovitis.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-59">摘要</h3>
<p>Studies on the commercial determinants of health (CDoH) are rapidly growing in Western countries. Nevertheless, despite the ubiquity of transnational alcohol corporations (TNACs)-a leading harmful commodity industry-in Nigeria and across Africa, few studies have focused specifically on alcohol marketing as a CDoH. TNACs in Nigeria and other low-resource settings deploy diverse and aggressive marketing strategies to mitigate the decline in youth drinking in many Western countries. Yet, no study to date has contextualised alcohol marketing as a CDoH and its impact on young people’s drinking. This study explores the awareness and impact of alcohol advertising and promotion on young people’s drinking behaviours in Benin, Nigeria.
We collected data through three focus group discussions (n = 26) and 53 semi-structured interviews with 18-24-year-old adolescents and young adults. Data were analysed thematically.
The findings show that participants were exposed to alcohol marketing on TV, radio, and social media and demonstrated a high awareness of various other alcohol promotional strategies. Participants acknowledged the persuasive influence of alcohol marketing in trying new products and changing brands temporarily and permanently. Celebrity advertising and endorsement through sports were also recounted as an impactful alcohol marketing strategy. Furthermore, quantity deals, discount sales, and other promotional strategies, facilitated impulse buying and heavy drinking.
The findings demonstrate how alcohol marketing in Nigeria is a major pervasive and harmful CDoH. Policymakers are encouraged to implement policies to mitigate the impact of alcohol marketing through prevention and intervention strategies, including marketing regulation and enforcement.</p>
