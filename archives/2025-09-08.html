<h2 id="article-1">1. Developing Community-Informed Communication Resources to Improve Human Papillomavirus Vaccine Uptake in Tonga.</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: Health expectations : an international journal of public participation in health care and health policy
<strong>发表日期</strong>: 2025-Oct

<h3 id="摘要">摘要</h3>
<p>Despite high coverage of routine childhood vaccines, uptake of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in the Pacific Island nation of Tonga has been slow. Culturally appropriate communication resources on the importance, safety, and effectiveness of the HPV vaccine are critical to support acceptance and uptake. To develop these resources, it is important to understand what people want to know. We aimed to explore HPV vaccine information needs among communities in Tonga, to inform a tailored HPV vaccine resource to support uptake.
We conducted a two phase qualitative study involving stakeholder consultation and feedback to inform the development of a vaccine educational resource. From June to October 2023 (Phase 1), eight focus groups and one interview were conducted with 24 adolescent girls, 32 parents, 15 teachers, seven nurses, and five immunisation program staff in Nuku’alofa, Tonga. Findings informed a flip chart on the HPV vaccine which was qualitatively piloted with nine community members and nine nurses in October 2023 (Phase 2).
Parents, girls, and teachers wanted clear information on the benefits and risks of the HPV vaccine. Immunisation providers lacked culturally specific resources in Tongan, and nurses requested a flip chart. All participants wanted Tongan or Pacific-specific data on HPV and cervical cancer disease burden. The flip chart was finalised in collaboration with the Tonga Ministry of Health and a local graphic designer. Piloting identified the need for training of nurses on the flip chart, and the potential for the resource to provide information to parents, school students and teachers.
To support HPV vaccine acceptance and uptake in Tonga, we integrated qualitative community and health provider insights to develop and pilot a culturally appropriate resource with locally designed images. Nationwide distribution will now support nurses and community leaders to share information about the HPV vaccine with their communities and additional resources will be developed for adolescent girls.</p>

<h2 id="article-2">2. SIRT1 as a potential target for age-related eye diseases: mechanisms and therapeutic strategies.</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: Human cell
<strong>发表日期</strong>: 2025-Sep-07

<h3 id="摘要-1">摘要</h3>
<p>Age-related eye diseases (AREDs) are the leading cause of visual impairment in the elderly, affecting the structure of the anterior and posterior segments of the eye, significantly reducing the quality of life of patients, and even leading to irreversible blindness. Typical AREDs include age-related cataract (ARC), dry eye disease (DED), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy (DR), the global prevalence of which continues to rise, becoming a serious public health concern. SIRT1 is an NAD + dependent deacetylase, which plays an important physiological regulatory role in ocular tissues, mainly affecting gene expression and various cellular processes by regulating the acetylation status of substrate proteins. Studies have shown that SIRT1 plays a key role in oxidative stress, inflammation, autophagy, apoptosis and metabolism, and its expression or activity decreases can accelerate cell senescence and promote the occurrence and development of AREDs. In addition, SIRT1 expression levels and changes in its activity have been shown to be strongly associated with AREDs, making it a potential target for disease intervention and therapy. Therefore, this review systematically summarizes the biological role and regulatory mechanism of SIRT1 in AREDs, and explored its potential value as a therapeutic target, providing theoretical basis for future drug development and clinical transformation.</p>

<h2 id="article-3">3. Clinical Characteristics and Management of Rare Metabolic Bone Diseases: An Audit of the Rare Metabolic Bone Disease Registry of India.</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: Calcified tissue international

<h3 id="摘要-2">摘要</h3>
<p>Rare diseases, defined by the 2002 Rare Disease Act, affect fewer than 5 in 10,000 individuals. Rare metabolic bone diseases (MBDs), such as osteogenesis imperfecta, hypophosphatasia, osteopetrosis, and other unclassified disorders, can disrupt bone development and remodeling, posing diagnostic and management challenges. This study analyzed data from the rarembd.in registry (2010-2024), a 15-year database documenting only rare MBDs. Clinical presentation and demographic data of patients with rare MBDs were collated. Common MBDs (osteoporosis, primary hyperparathyroidism) were excluded. Genetic testing was performed in a subset of patients. There was a total of 218 patients with an almost equal gender distribution (male-to-female ratio of 1:1.07) and a mean age of 29.1 ± 18.9 years. The registry identified 29 rare MBDs with three main disease categories: demineralization disorders (50.4%), disorders of bone matrix and cartilage formation (32.5%), and sclerotic disorders (13.7%); with a smaller proportion categorized as unclassified bone disorders (2.7%). Rickets/osteomalacia (27.1%) was the most common, followed by osteogenesis imperfecta (23.4%) and fibrous dysplasia/McCune-Albright syndrome (18.8%). Fractures affected 57.7% of patients, with 24.5% experiencing multiple fractures, while 31.1% exhibited skeletal deformities. Mutation analysis in our registry identified pathogenic variants in the SOST, TGFβ1, SLC34A3, ALPL, and VCP genes, confirming the genetic basis of sclerosteosis, Camurati-Engelmann disease, hypophosphatemic rickets, hypophosphatasia, and IBMPFD, respectively. Different management strategies were used that included teriparatide, bisphosphonates (zoledronate or alendronate) with total contact casting, intralesional zoledronate, denosumab, calcium, active vitamin D, and recombinant human growth hormone. Total parathyroidectomy was performed in specific cases. The registry classified RMBDs into four categories, with demineralization disorders being the most common, followed by bone matrix/cartilage formation disorders, sclerotic diseases, and unclassified cases. There were 29 RMBDs, and rickets/osteomalacia was the most prevalent subtype, tumor-induced osteomalacia followed by familial hypophosphatemic osteomalacia. Among the unclassified bone disorders, fragility fractures emerged as the most common presentation.</p>

<h2 id="article-4">4. Robotic upper urinary tract reconstruction for ureteral stricture: a single-center series.</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: Journal of robotic surgery
<strong>发表日期</strong>: 2025-Sep-07
<strong>链接</strong>: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40914922">PubMed</a></p>

<h3 id="摘要-3">摘要</h3>
<p>The surgical approach of ureteral stricture has changed dramatically over the past 15 years with the rise of robotic upper urinary tract reconstruction. This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of all robotic ureteral reconstructions performed at a single academic center for ureteral stricture and to assess the predictive factors of stricture recurrence. The charts of all patients who underwent robot-assisted ureteral reconstruction between 2013 and 2024 at a single academic center were retrospectively reviewed. Many different surgical techniques were used including non-refluxing reimplantation with or without psoas hitch, refluxing ureteral reimplantation (side-to-side), Boari flap, uretero-ureterostomy, ureterolysis and buccal mucosa graft (BMG) ureteroplasty. The primary outcome was the absence of stricture recurrence, defined as no need for repeat surgery, urinary drainage, or symptomatic upper urinary tract dilation at the last follow-up. Sixty patients, accounting for 63 ureteral reconstructions, were included in the final analysis. Twenty-five patients experienced early postoperative complications (40%), the majority being Clavien-Dindo grade 2. There were only three (5%) major complications (Clavien-Dindo grade 3b). Stricture recurrence occurred in six patients (10%), with a median time to recurrence of 2.5 months postoperatively. Radiotherapy was the only factor significantly associated with an increased risk of stricture recurrence. The present series confirm the overall low morbidity and low recurrence rate of robotic ureteral reconstruction using a variety of surgical techniques. Comparative studies with longer follow-up periods are necessary to evaluate outcomes in comparison to traditional surgical approaches.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-4">摘要</h3>
<p>Reveal the changing rule of the positional relationship between the uncinate process of cervical spine and vertebral artery by measuring the relevant parameters between the uncinate process of cervical spine and vertebral artery in different age groups.
A retrospective study was conducted on 1240 cases of cervical spine imaging data from 2018 to 2021 in the Radiology Department of the Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia Medical University. The distance between the uncinate process superior ridge and vertebral artery and the maximum of pedicle transverse angle, the minimum of pedicle transverse angle, the range of pedicle transverse angle and the pedicle width were measured according to age groups.
The distance between the uncinate process superior ridge and vertebral artery increased with age. The maximum of pedicle transverse angle, the minimum of pedicle transverse angle and the range of pedicle transverse angle decreased with aging. The pedicle width increased with age and vertebral sequence. C3 and C7 showed significant differences in the distance between the uncinate process superior ridge and vertebral artery, the maximum of pedicle transverse angle and the minimum of pedicle transverse angle, the range of pedicle transverse angle and the pedicle width among age groups (P &lt; 0.05). In the correlation analysis, age was positively correlated with the distance between the uncinate process superior ridge and vertebral artery (r = 0.13), pedicle width (r = 0.29), and negatively correlated with the maximum (r = - 0.06), minimum (r = - 0.03), and the range of pedicle transverse angle (r = - 0.05).
The anatomical relationship between the uncinate process and the vertebral artery plays an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of vertebral artery type cervical spondylosis. Understanding the significant differences in the anatomical parameters of different segments between age groups, sequences and sides can ensure the safety of the operation. It can provide important theoretical basis and technical support for the imaging evaluation of vertebral artery type cervical spondylosis and the selection of screw Angle and screw diameter matching in anterior/posterior cervical surgery.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-5">摘要</h3>
<p>Pituitary adenomas (PAs) are generally benign neoplasms, though in rare cases may exhibit aggressive behavior. In 2024, the PANOMEN-3 workshop released a new clinical-pathological classification. The objective of this study was to examine the potential of the PANOMEN-3 classification to predict prognosis of PAs and guide treatment in our single center cohort of patients with PAs.
A longitudinal, retrospective, observational study was performed on patients with a PA diagnosis. The PANOMEN 3 classification was applied to each patient 6 months after surgery. Resultant grades were correlated with surgical outcome, disease recurrence or progression.
289 patients were included. According to the PANOMEN-3 classification, 9 patients (3.1%) were designated as grade 0, 101 patients as grade 1 (34.9%), 140 patients as grade 2 (48.4%) and 39 patients as a grade 3 (13.5%). At last follow-up assessment, 186 patients were found to be disease-free (64.4%), 93 patients (32.5%) exhibited a stable residual, 9 patients (3.1%) had recurrence and/or progression of their PA. The risk of recurrent/residual disease was increased in grade 1 (OR: OR:1.4 95%IC: 1.2-1.7), grade 2 (OR:1.5 95%IC: 1.2-1.9) and grade 3 (OR:5.7 95%IC: 2.7-12.5). Grades 1, 2 and 3 were associated with a shorter disease-free survival interval as compared to those with a grade 0 PANOMEN-3 score.
The PANOMEN-3 score is useful in clinical practice, aiding physicians to better plan patient follow-up, as well as to manage residual disease and treatment strategies post-surgery.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-6">摘要</h3>
<p>Teleproctoring offers a remote alternative to traditional surgical mentoring, addressing logistical barriers in robotic surgery education. We conducted a prospective trial to assess the feasibility and trainee perception of teleproctoring using the Proximie® platform. Eighteen surgeons with limited robotic experience performed a standardized enterotomy closure on synthetic bowel models using the da Vinci Si system, while receiving real-time remote guidance from an expert located 2570 km away. Participants rated technical aspects-such as image quality, audio, and annotation functionality-highly. Overall satisfaction, confidence gained, and the educational value of the experience were positively reported. Telestration capabilities allowed annotations to be displayed within the robotic console, facilitating continuous guidance without disrupting the workflow. No major technical issues occurred. Teleproctoring is a feasible and well-received strategy in robotic surgery training. It may help expand access to expert mentorship and support global efforts in surgical education.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-7">摘要</h3>
<p>The present study examined responses to COVID-19 at the beginning of the pandemic, April 2020, among a representative sample of 880 Poles. Participants described their religious beliefs, their emotional reactions to the pandemic, the changes they had made in their behavior since the onset of the pandemic, and their political orientation (left-right). Roman Catholics felt more threatened by the pandemic than non-believers, and Catholics reacted more strongly to the pandemic than non-believers in terms of feeling scared, paralyzed by fear, panicked, fearful, sad, woebegone, and lost, whereas there were no such differences on other emotional reactions. Compared to non-believers, Catholics changed their behavior to be more compliant with public health guidelines and changed some behaviors that were not recommended by public health officials but were popular (e.g., stocking up on food and on cleaning products). There were however, no differences between the two groups in terms of wearing masks, limiting leaving home, and avoiding contact with those who were ill. Catholics had weaker intentions to get vaccinated than non-believers. Catholics’ political orientation was more right-wing than non-believers’ orientation, and the difference in vaccination intentions between Catholics and non-believers disappeared after controlling for differences in political orientation. Controlling for political orientation did not change the results of the analyses of emotional reactions and behavioral changes.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-8">摘要</h3>
<p>American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities experienced a disproportionate increase in opioid-related fatal and non-fatal poisonings during the COVID-19 pandemic. Access to treatment, such as medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), became even more critical, although research among this population is limited. We completed qualitative interviews with substance use disorder (SUD) treatment providers (i.e., MOUD prescribers, non-prescribing clinicians, non-clinical support staff) to assess the impact of COVID-19 on MOUD care among AI/AN adults.
Sixty-minute semi-structured interviews were completed with providers working in SUD treatment (N = 25). Eligible providers represented 6 programs serving rural Tribal and urban areas primarily in the Pacific Northwest United States. Transcripts were independently reviewed and analyzed for themes based upon the research aims.
Nineteen female and six male providers completed interviews. Four themes were identified: (1) Beneficial policy changes for MOUD delivery; (2) Telehealth as the biggest policy shift; (3) Addressing complexity, and (4) Cultural services. Findings indicated providers viewed the introduction of telehealth, implementation of mobile services, and expanded take home dosing as positive and leading to increased treatment access. However, barriers related to the internet, transportation, and reimbursement of telehealth remain.
Providers highlighted the utility in the expansion and sustainment of telehealth. Flexible policies for MOUD were particularly beneficial during the height of COVID-19 to maintain and increase access to treatment. Providing a menu of treatment options, emphasizing cultural engagement and social support were deemed necessary to enhance AI/AN community driven solutions in curbing the opioid poisoning public health crisis.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-10">摘要</h3>
<p>Research suggests that household social risks are associated with worse mental health in adolescents, but prior studies have been limited. We evaluated the association between social risks and symptoms of depression and anxiety in adolescents 1 year later by conducting a retrospective cohort study at an integrated health system with 45 practices. Adolescents were screened for depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) and anxiety using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 (GAD-2). Of the 4748 adolescents, 1220 (25.7%) had at least 1 social risk, 226 (5.7%) reported symptoms of depression, and 410 (10.2%) reported symptoms of anxiety. Adolescents in households with at least 1 social risk were more likely to report symptoms of depression (β = 0.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.07-0.23) and anxiety (β = 0.21, 95% CI = 0.11-0.31) and had greater odds of a positive PHQ-2 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.12-2.01) and positive GAD-2 (OR = 1.57; 95% CI = 1.32, 1.87).</p>

<h3 id="摘要-11">摘要</h3>
<p>The relationship between dietary biotin intake and cognitive function remains unclear. This study explores the association between biotin and dementia, and the mediating role of inflammation indicators. Dietary biotin intake was assessed via the 24-h recall questionnaire. Dementia outcomes were identified through “algorithmically defined outcomes,” identified through an algorithm integrating self-reports, hospital admissions, and death certificate records. Participants aged 40-69 with complete biotin and baseline data were included. During a 11.25-year median follow-up, 1256 incident dementia cases occurred among 122 959 participants. Cox proportional hazards models showed that compared to the lowest biotin intake (Q1), biotin reduced the risk of all-cause dementia (HR: 0.75[0.64,0.88] p &lt; 0.001 for Q2; HR: 0.68[0.58,0.81] p &lt; 0.001 for Q3; HR: 0.67[0.56,0.81] p &lt; 0.001 for Q4) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (HR: 0.74[0.58,0.96] p = 0.026 for Q2; HR: 0.65[0.49,0.85] p = 0.002 for Q3). Restricted cubic splines (RCSs) revealed an “L-shaped” nonlinear relationship between biotin and all-cause dementia (p nonlinear &lt; 0.001) and Alzheimer’s dementia (p nonlinear = 0.004) and exhibited the saturation effect. Multicategorical mediation analysis suggested that systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), a composite inflammatory marker calculated from platelet, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts, mediated the association partially. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses confirmed stable results. Higher dietary biotin intake may reduce the risk of dementia.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-12">摘要</h3>
<p>BACKGROUND The SENTINEL influenza surveillance system has been used in Poland since 2004, incorporating both epidemiological and virological monitoring of influenza viruses. SENTINEL works in cooperation with general practitioners, 16 Voivodship Sanitary Epidemiological Stations (VSES), and the National Influenza Centre (NIC). NON-SENTINEL samples are collected from places that do not participate in the SENTINEL program. This enables continuous observation of virological and epidemiological situation in the country. The aim of the study was to conduct a comparative analysis of circulating influenza and influenza-like viruses during the 2022/2023 and 2023/2024 epidemic seasons, as monitored through the SENTINEL and NON-SENTINEL surveillance systems in Poland. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study material consisted of nasal and throat swabs collected by the VSES. Molecular biology methods were employed for virus detection and identification. The analyses were based on data obtained from the SENTINEL system for the 2022/2023 and 2023/2024 epidemic seasons. RESULTS During the 2022/2023 epidemic season, co-dominance of the A/H1N1/pdm09 and A/H3N2/subtypes was noted, whereas the 2023/2024 epidemic season in Europe was dominated by the A/H1N1/pdm09 subtype. Among the influenza-like viruses, SARS-CoV-2 and RSV were the most frequently detected in both epidemic seasons. CONCLUSIONS The influenza surveillance system in Poland enables continuous, weekly monitoring of the epidemiological situation throughout each season. This allows for a rapid response in the event of the emergence of new influenza virus variants. The results obtained as part of influenza surveillance in Poland are consistent with those observed in other European countries.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-13">摘要</h3>
<p>The behavior of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) released from tire road wear particles (TRWPs) in human digestive fluids may pose a significant risk to human health. However, the current understanding of the release pattern and influencing factors of PAHs from TRWPs is still insufficient. In this study, the release characteristics of PAHs from UV-aging TRWPs (ATRWPs) were systematically investigated by in vitro digestive simulation experiments, release kinetic model fitting and control variable experiments. The results showed that the total amount of PAHs released from ATRWPs in simulated intestinal and gastrointestinal fluids reached 32.7 and 60.5 mg/kg, respectively, with the highest amount of Phenanthrene (22.4 mg/kg), and the Elovich and double-constant release models demonstrated that PAHs release behaviors involved non-homogeneous diffusion by multiple mechanisms. In addition, UV aging significantly contributed to the release of PAHs from TRWPs, and digestive enzymes further exacerbated this process to some extent. In addition, the release behavior of PAHs from TRWPs was similar to that of PAHs from their main constituents (Road wear particles, Tire wear particles). These results suggest that aging effects, digestive enzymes, and composition of tire road wear micro are the main factors influencing the release behavior of PAHs from TRWPs.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-14">摘要</h3>
<p>There is limited high-quality evidence to guide plasma transfusion, and plasma transfusion practices remain variable.
This is a retrospective cohort study that included adult medical and intensive care unit (ICU) inpatients (age ≥ 18 years) admitted to 23 hospitals in Canada between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2022, when both whole blood derived (~290 mL) and apheresis plasma (~250 mL) were available for transfusion. Nine additional hospital sites with missing plasma data or coagulation testing were excluded. Data collected included patient demographics, most responsible diagnoses, procedures, laboratory tests, transfusion information, and physician characteristics.
Among 950,740 included hospital admissions at 23 hospitals, there were 11,163 admissions with plasma use, with 46,377 plasma units transfused. Of the plasma recipients, 63.5% were male, with a mean age of 61.2 years (SD 16.4). Most plasma transfusions were administered in the ICU (64.1%). The number of plasma units transfused per 1000 inpatient days across centers varied from a median (IQR) of 0.2 (0.1-0.4) to 11.0 (10.6-12.0) units. There was significant variability in pre-transfusion INR values across hospitals (ranging from a median (IQR) of 1.5 (1.3-1.9) to 2.5 (1.4-4.6)) and physician specialties (ranging from a median (IQR) of 1.4 (1.3-1.8) to 2.2 (1.8-3.0)). There was no significant change in plasma utilization over the study period.
This study demonstrated variability in plasma utilization and pre-transfusion INR thresholds across hospitals and physician specialties. This highlights the importance of developing evidence-based guidelines and effective knowledge translation to guide appropriate plasma use.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-15">摘要</h3>
<p>This study aimed to evaluate how major US health care policy changes have influenced long-term Medicare reimbursement trends for upper-extremity flap and microvascular procedures from 2002 to 2023.
Reimbursement data for 28 common flap and microvascular procedures were extracted from the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule database using Current Procedural Terminology codes. Adjustments for inflation were made using the Consumer Price Index. Statistical analyses included descriptive evaluations, trend analyses, and compound annual growth rate calculations. Sensitivity analyses were performed across four policy-relevant time periods.
From 2002 to 2023, inflation-adjusted Medicare reimbursement amounts for flap and microvascular procedures declined by an average of 36.9%. The compound annual growth rate was -2.3%, and inflation-adjusted reimbursements saw a sharper decline of 4.5% annually. Work relative value units increased modestly by 7.2%, whereas facility and malpractice relative value units increased by 15.9% and 95.7%, respectively. The steepest declines in reimbursement occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2023), with an average decrease of 17.1%. Linear regression analyses revealed statistically significant downward trends for all procedures.
Medicare reimbursement amounts for upper-extremity flap and microvascular procedures have not kept pace with inflation, reflecting a broader trend of declining economic viability in surgical subspecialties.
This trend may exacerbate disparities in health care access, as physicians face increasing financial pressures. Policymakers must address these challenges to ensure sustainable compensation and equitable care for patients. Future research should explore strategies to mitigate the impact of declining reimbursement rates on patient care and provider practice patterns.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-16">摘要</h3>
<p>Rare diseases collectively affect approximately 30 million people in the United States. Despite advances in genomic medicine, early diagnosis is challenging because of limited awareness of, accessibility to, and disparities in health care resources. We assessed the real-world experiences of patients with rare diseases in Pennsylvania and evaluated the effect of delayed diagnosis on psychosocial and financial burdens.
The Pennsylvania Rare Disease Advisory Council conducted a Rare Disease Needs Assessment Survey from September 2020 through January 2023. The survey, distributed through multiple channels, collected responses from patients, caregivers, and rare disease advocates in Pennsylvania. We analyzed quantitative and qualitative data on diagnosis, health care access, financial burden, and psychosocial support.
A total of 1214 respondents participated, representing a diverse spectrum of rare diseases and demographic groups. More than half (57.8%) of respondents indicated diagnostic delays of ≥1 year, which were associated with additional misdiagnoses, increased annual spending, out-of-state travel, and reduced work and school hours; however, diagnostic delays were not associated with disease category. Many respondents (48.5%) reported &gt;$5000 in annual spending related to care for their rare disease, and 24.9% were unable to access medications because of financial reasons. Diagnostic delays were associated with worse perspectives on the efficacy of care across multiple domains even after a correct diagnosis was achieved. Patients aged 0 to 20 years had a faster time to diagnosis than patients aged &gt;20 years did.
Patients with rare diseases in Pennsylvania face substantial barriers to diagnosis, specialized care, and financial support. Despite policy initiatives, gaps remain in genetic testing access, specialist availability, and psychosocial resources. Addressing these issues through improved diagnostics, expanded access to care, and targeted policy changes is essential to enhancing patient outcomes and quality of life.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-17">摘要</h3>
<p>This study aimed to develop a tailored International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) Core Set for driving rehabilitation in South Korea, addressing the functional needs of individuals with disabilities and the gaps in the current rehabilitation system.
An initial item pool was created based on focus group interviews with 13 individuals with disabilities who use assistive driving technologies. This was followed by two Delphi rounds with 12 occupational therapy experts. Items were rated for relevance using Lawshe’s content validity ratio (CVR), with a threshold of 0.54. Additional items were proposed during the process and reviewed in the second round.
The final Core Set included 55 ICF categories: 17 body functions, 21 activities and participation items, and 17 environmental factors. These categories reflect key cognitive, sensory, and physical demands of driving, as well as social and environmental conditions that influence driving performance.
The developed ICF Core Set provides a function-based framework for driving rehabilitation that is applicable to the Korean context. It offers a foundation for assessment, service design, and policy development. Future research should examine its clinical utility and cross-disciplinary applicability.
This study presents a structured ICF Core Set tailored for driving rehabilitation, enabling a standardized framework to assess the functional needs of individuals with physical disabilities who wish to drive.The Core Set highlights environmental and policy-level barriers in South Korea’s current driving rehabilitation system.By understanding and utilizing the ICF Core Set, professionals can better assess and address the diverse needs of their clients, leading to more effective and holistic rehabilitation outcomes.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-18">摘要</h3>
<p>Copper (Cu) is an essential micronutrient in various enzymatic and physiological functions. However, excessive copper intake, mainly resulting from industrial emissions and improper agricultural practices, has raised growing concerns due to its toxicological effects, particularly on the male reproductive system. This review summarizes current research progress on copper-induced reproductive toxicity in males, emphasizing its impact on sperm quality, androgen production, and testicular structure and function. The underlying molecular mechanisms are discussed in detail, including oxidative stress, apoptosis, autophagy, ferroptosis, and cuproptosis. In addition, emerging therapeutic approaches, such as antioxidant treatments and copper chelators, are evaluated for their potential to mitigate these toxic effects. A comprehensive understanding of copper-induced male reproductive toxicity may offer new insights into the prevention and management of metal-related infertility.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-19">摘要</h3>
<p>Wheat yellow mosaic virus (WYMV) is the main cause of wheat yellow mosaic disease. Although its regulation of protein translation and interactions with host proteins are well-studied, independent regulation of the virus genome is poorly understood. This study performed in vitro experiments investigating replication regulation by the 5’ UTR and 3’ UTR of WYMV RNA2. The results confirm that the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NIb) can only recognize and catalyze the synthesis of 3’ 190 nt complementary chains in vitro. RNA structure probing and mutation analysis identified 3597AUU and 3607GGCU as novel interaction sites of NIb; both are essential for maintaining normal replication. Our findings provide an empirical basis for in vivo experiments on regulation of WYMV genome replication and provide theoretical basis for the prevention and control of WYMV-related crop diseases.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-20">摘要</h3>
<p>Increases in absenteeism among schoolchildren may precede increases in incidence of community-level respiratory diseases. This study assessed the correlations and predictive values between all-cause absenteeism among kindergarten through grade 12 students and community-level increases in influenza and COVID-19.
We used absenteeism data from 4 school districts (1 each in Arizona, California, Nevada, and Wisconsin) between fall 2018 (starting approximately late August) and spring 2022 (typically ending in May) to calculate correlations between school absenteeism and community-level cases of influenza, percentage of influenza-like illness, and COVID-19. We estimated the positive predictive value (PPV) of a ≥20% increase in school absences to predict a ≥20% increase in community respiratory disease 1 or 2 weeks later.
We observed a median correlation of 0.4 between absenteeism and influenza cases across school years and districts, with a maximum of 0.8. COVID-19 cases had a median correlation of 0.1 with school absenteeism during the 2021-2022 school year. The median PPV for predicting increases 2 weeks ahead was 0.4 for influenza and was 0.3 for COVID-19.
Correlations and PPVs between all-cause school absenteeism and respiratory disease were variable, often &lt;0.5. School and public health officials may find absenteeism an inconsistent predictor of community-level respiratory diseases, limiting its utility for syndromic surveillance. Standardizing absence definitions and improving reporting timeliness may enhance its effectiveness.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-21">摘要</h3>
<p>Although wastewater monitoring for virus detection has increased in communities worldwide, public awareness, understanding, questions, and concerns about wastewater monitoring are largely unknown. We assessed awareness, knowledge, and support for wastewater monitoring for detection of viruses and bacteria among US residents and elicited questions and concerns from residents about its use.
We conducted a survey among a racially and ethnically diverse sample of residents in Colorado, Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska, and Texas to assess awareness, knowledge, and support of wastewater monitoring. We also asked an open-ended question to elicit further questions and concerns from survey participants about wastewater monitoring. Two independent reviewers coded the responses to the open-ended question.
Among 516 survey participants (52% White, 31% Black, 27% Hispanic ethnicity), 289 (56%) were aware that local public health departments and federal health agencies tested sewer water yet 334 (65%) knew “little or nothing” about wastewater monitoring. After participants were exposed to a brief description of the wastewater monitoring process, 80% “supported” or “strongly supported” wastewater monitoring to detect viruses and bacteria. When we analyzed responses to the open-ended question on wastewater monitoring, 3 broad categories and 9 subcategories of questions and concerns about wastewater monitoring emerged: (1) how wastewater monitoring works (mechanics, accuracy, cost, safety), (2) what is done with the findings generated by wastewater monitoring (public accessibility, government trust, public health response), and (3) what protections were in place against misuse of findings (privacy, fairness).
Proactive public education is needed to increase understanding, build support, and prevent disinformation about wastewater monitoring. Local systems are needed to share findings rapidly, clearly, and simply.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-22">摘要</h3>
<p>Esophagectomy causes anatomical changes that can lead to rapid food transit and reactive hypoglycemia (RH). Patients are advised on eating patterns postesophagectomy to prevent RH, but its true incidence and the impact of dietary recommendations remain under-researched.
Individuals &gt;12 months postesophagectomy were recruited from the National Centre for Oesophageal and Gastric Cancer at St James’s Hospital in Dublin, Ireland. Over 7 days, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) captured glucose readings, with food and symptom diaries documenting dietary intake and symptoms. The nutrition composition of meals was calculated, and food diaries were coded for the following eating patterns: leaving &gt;3 h between meals, simple sugars with meals, fluid with meals, and alcohol with meals. Data analysis compared eating patterns preceding asymptomatic and symptomatic RH events. In all cases, P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Thirty-two participants completed the study, with 21,504 glucose readings and 1276 meals analyzed. CGM identified 226 meals (17.7%) followed by RH events, 19 of which were symptomatic. Meals associated with RH events were higher in carbohydrate (35.3 g vs 31.7 g; P = 0.036), fiber (4.11 g vs 3.15 g; P = 0.020), and sugar (12.65 g vs 10.96 g; P = 0.048). Leaving &gt;3 h between meals and consuming alcohol with meals also increased RH risk. Nutrient composition and eating patterns did not differentiate symptomatic from asymptomatic RH events.
Total carbohydrate content and specific eating patterns appeared to significantly influence RH incidence, with most RH events being asymptomatic. CGM may serve as a useful adjunct to dietary interventions in the management of RH in patients postesophagectomy.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-23">摘要</h3>
<p>Clubroot, caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae, significantly impacts cruciferous crop production worldwide. Biocontrol is an environmentally friendly and promising approach for clubroot management. Endophytic bacteria are known for their ability to promote plant growth and induce resistance against plant diseases. In the Plasmodiophora brassicae-Brassica pathosystem, microbial communities are poorly understood, and their biocontrol potential for clubroot remains unexplored.
In this study, we investigated the endophytic bacterial communities in root samples with different levels of clubroot infection. Subsequently, we employed sequencing analysis and culture-dependent isolation to profile these communities. Our results indicated differences in bacterial composition between D (galled) and H (asymptomatic) roots. Notably the enrichment of Pseudomonas species in H. Culture-dependent bacterial isolation suggested that three Pseudomonas strains (H10, H13, and H15) from H had biocontrol potential, which was confirmed by their effects of 49% reductions in resting spore germination, along with abilities in environmental pH adjustment and biofilm formation. Specifically, during clubroot development, Pseudomonas brassicacearum strain H13 reduced clubroot severity by 51%, suppressed Plasmodiophora brassicae biomass by over 12% in roots and 37% in soil, effectively colonized roots, and increased soil pH. Strain H13 also influenced the expression of plant hormone-related genes, including a 3.4-fold up-regulation of NPR1 at 7 days post-inoculation (dpi), and down-regulation of CKX, AO1, and DWF4 by 84%, 88%, and 40%, respectively, at 21 dpi.
These findings suggest that endophytic Pseudomonas strains, particularly strain H13, hold promise as effective biocontrol agents by reducing chemical fungicide application for sustainable clubroot management. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-24">摘要</h3>
<p>Submarine environments pose unique challenges to maintaining physical activity and exercise routines due to confined spaces, demanding schedules, and limited resources. This study investigated submariners’ physical activity patterns, sleep quality, and perceived exercise barriers in both land- and sea-based settings, with the goal of informing targeted health interventions.
Ethics approval was granted by the Defence Science and Technology Group and Edith Cowan University review panels. This cross-sectional study surveyed 21 Royal Australian Navy submariners (25-48 years; 18 male) using a modified version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Participants reported weekly engagement in general physical activity (e.g., walking, moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity) and structured exercise training (high-intensity interval training, moderate-intensity continuous training, and resistance training [RT]), as well as sitting time and sleep duration. Additional items assessed perceived barriers and motivations to exercise, time spent on land and at sea over the past 12 months (9 ± 3 and 3 ± 3 months, respectively), and their longest continuous deployment. Descriptive statistics and paired t-tests were used to compare outcomes between land and sea environments.
Total physical activity was lower (P &lt; .001) at sea (118 ± 30 minutes/week) compared to land (745 ± 60 minutes/week), with the greatest reductions observed in walking (-86%, P &lt; .001) and moderate-intensity cardiovascular training (-95%, P = .002). High-intensity interval training declined by 81% (P = .006), and RT dropped by 84% (P = .045). Reported barriers at sea included water usage restrictions (57%), limited space (43%), inadequate facilities (43%), time constraints (38%), fatigue (38%), and noise restrictions (19%). Sleep quality declined by 37% at sea (P &lt; .001), though changes in sleep duration were not statistically significant. Sitting time increased by 51% on workdays (P = .014).
Sea deployments are associated with substantial declines in physical activity and sleep quality among submariners, accompanied by increased sitting time and widespread behavioral disengagement. These findings highlight the need for practical strategies to support health, well-being, and operational readiness in constrained environments. Strengths of the study include context-specific survey design and rich participant engagement, as reflected by detailed qualitative responses. Limitations include small sample size, variability in responses, potential recall bias, and the inability to assess survey reliability because of ethical constraints. Future research should prioritize longitudinal designs and explore implementable interventions to promote physical activity and sleep during deployment. These findings may also apply to other constrained environments, such as naval surface ships, remote field sites, or mining operations, where similar occupational barriers exist. Overall, these results offer valuable insight into how deployment conditions shape health behaviors in submariners and provide a foundation for developing evidence-based strategies to improve activity and well-being in this and similar populations.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-25">摘要</h3>
<p>Initial studies identified the Perceive, Recall, Plan and Perform Assessment (PRPP-A) as a cognitive assessment with potential for culturally safe use with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples with neurocognitive impairments in the Northern Territory of Australia. This study examines construct and concurrent validity of the PRPP-A.
Data were collected from a medical record review. Construct validity was examined using multifaceted Rasch analysis on 44 PRPP-A scores. Concurrent validity was evaluated using Pearson’s product-moment correlation to examine relationships between the PRPP-A and Functional Independence Measure Cognitive subscale (FIM Cognition).
PRPP-A test items demonstrate good fit with the Rasch model, supporting unidimensionality. A hierarchy of cognitive strategies was generated. Ordering of test items was representative of the information processing skills required for task performance. There was a statistically significant, positive correlation between PRPP-A Total scores with FIM Cognition scores (r = 0.60, p = 0.003). The strongest relationship was identified between the PRPP-A Plan Quadrant and FIM Cognition scores (r = 0.68, p &lt; 0.001). The strength of the relationship suggests evidence for concurrent validity.
The findings present emerging evidence supporting the construct and concurrent validity of PRPP-A when used with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Northern Territory with neurocognitive impairment.
The findings in this study represent an important step towards generating an evidence base upon which occupational therapists can draw to inform valid assessment of functional cognition with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.PRPP-A provides a cognitive assessment approach that may be suitable for culturally diverse communities with low levels of resources as the assessment procedures are flexible, using everyday tasks performed in the client’s context using familiar tools, objects and materials.This study can facilitate and inform the clinical reasoning of occupational therapists to ensure the provision of culturally safe care and determine if the PRPP-A is suitable for the individual clients they work with.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-26">摘要</h3>
<p>Workers in industry settings are often exposed to complex noise, which poses a greater risk to hearing loss than continuous noise at equivalent energy levels. Previous studies have identified kurtosis as an essential metric for evaluating complex noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). This study aimed to characterize the distribution of workers exposed to complex noise, examine the associations between kurtosis and changes in hearing thresholds at various frequencies, and explore kurtosis’s role in estimating NIHL and its integration into occupational hearing loss prevention programs.
The study quantitatively analyzed data from 2400 workers exposed to industrial complex noise and 1520 non-noise-exposed workers in China. Both arithmetic and geometric average kurtosis were used to characterize the work-shift noise records. Linear regression models assessed noise-induced permanent threshold shift (NIPTS) across different frequency ranges.
For workers exposed to average noise levels between 80 and 92 dBA, increased kurtosis levels correlated with worsening NIPTS across frequencies from 0.5 to 8 kHz. However, the impact of kurtosis at lower noise exposure levels (70-79 dBA) remains uncertain.
Kurtosis is crucial for predicting hearing loss among workers exposed to complex noise at average levels of 85 and 90 dBA. The findings have potential implications for occupational safety and health, particularly for the recruitment of workers into hearing loss prevention programs. Further risk assessment analysis could use the noise kurtosis metric to examine the excess risk of NIHL associated with complex noise exposure.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-27">摘要</h3>
<p>Occupational heat stress recommendations aim to achieve thermal equilibrium and keep core temperature (Tc) below 38.0°C. We assessed the recommended alert limit curves when: (1) work-rest ratios are adjusted based on wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) at a fixed rate of metabolic heat production (Hprod) and (2) Hprod is adjusted based on WBGT at a fixed work-rest ratio. We tested the hypothesis that adhering to occupational heat stress recommendations results in thermal equilibrium and prevents TC from exceeding 38.0°C.
Unacclimated adults completed 4-hour exposures at a fixed WBGT, Hprod, and work-rest ratio. There were six iterations of compliant trials (n = 70 observations; A: 24.1°C, 431 W, 60:0 min; B: 26.6°C, 461 W, 45:15 min; C: 28.4°C, 462 W, 30:30 min; D: 29.7, 453 W, 15:45 min; E: 27.3°C, 412 W, 30:30 min; F: 31.6°C, 290 W, 30:30 min) and two iterations of noncompliant trials (n = 24 observations; G: 31.6°C, 413 W, 30:30 min; H: 36.1°C, 453 W, 15:45 min).
Mean and peak TC across the compliant trials were 37.6°C ± 0.3°C and 37.9°C ± 0.3°C. Thus, 65/70 (93%) and 44/70 (63%) trials did not exceed a mean or peak core TC of 38.0°C. Mean and peak TC across the noncompliant trials exceeded 38.0°C in all trials. The rate of heat gain differed between compliant and noncompliant trials (0.08°C ± 0.07°C/h vs. 0.41°C ± 0.34°C/h; p &lt; 0.0001) but on average thermal equilibrium was &lt; 0.1°C/h in the compliant trials.
Compliance with the occupational heat stress recommendations resulted in thermal equilibrium and mitigated the development of excessive heat strain.

<h3 id="摘要-28">摘要</h3>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) can modernize occupational health and safety (OHS) practice and provide solutions to the most complex health and safety challenges. Empirical data on firm-level AI utilization in OHS practice remain limited. The objective of this study was to examine AI use for OHS and firm-level descriptive and OHS characteristics associated with AI use.
A total of 810 OHS professionals in British Columbia and Ontario, Canada were surveyed in the summer of 2024. Surveys asked about firm-level AI use for OHS and items asked about descriptive and OHS characteristics. Participants were also asked about perceived AI concerns and OHS impact. A multivariate logistic regression model was fitted to examine factors associated with firm-level AI use for OHS.
In total, 29% reported firm-level AI use for OHS. Larger-sized firms and those with hybrid work arrangements had a greater odds of AI use for OHS. Also, firms with high workplace hazard exposure had a greater odds of AI OHS use. More positive perceptions of AI’s impact on OHS were associated with firm-level AI use for OHS.
AI use for OHS may be concentrated among hazardous firms and those with the conditions to support technological adoption. Research examining AI’s effectiveness in OHS settings is needed to guide evidence-based implementation in occupational health practice.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-29">摘要</h3>
<p>Inflammation impacts the prognosis of numerous types of tumors. Inflammatory indicators such as the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio, and neutrophil-to-eosinophil ratio (NER) have emerged as potential prognostic markers and are closely correlated with the outcomes of cancer patients. However, the connection between NER and cancer prognosis remains incompletely understood. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the potential of the inflammatory marker NER as a prognostic indicator in cancer patients.
A thorough search was conducted across PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library, with a cutoff date of August 2024. Relevant data were extracted, and hazard ratios (HRs) and relative risks (RRs), along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were calculated to assess the prognostic impact of the NER on overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and the objective response rate (ORR). Stata version 18 statistical software was utilized for the meta-analysis of the literature that met the inclusion criteria.
Seven cohort studies encompassing a total of 1,336 cancer patients were included in this meta-analysis. These findings indicate that lower NER is associated with improved PFS in cancer patients. Additionally, in cancer patients undergoing immunotherapy, lower NER levels are linked to a better ORR. A lower NER is correlated with improved OS and ORR in patients with metastatic renal cancer who are receiving immunotherapy.
In cancer patients, elevated NER is associated with poorer PFS and ORR. Similarly, high NER levels in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma undergoing immunotherapy are linked to worse OS and ORR. The inflammatory marker NER, which serves as an efficacious prognostic indicator for cancer patients, offers profound insights into related cancers in the context of immunotherapy. In the future, high-quality prospective studies are warranted to corroborate these findings.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-31">摘要</h3>
<p>Almond blossom blight, caused by Monilinia spp., is a notable fungal disease associated with intensified crop management practices. In this study, we aimed to investigate the epidemiology of Monilinia spp. on almonds in two orchards in the Ebro Valley, with a focus on (i) primary inoculum sources through sampling of affected mummified fruiting structures from trees and the ground before blooming; (ii) secondary inoculum sources postblooming; and (iii) disease dynamics throughout the season in relation to meteorological data.
Monilinia laxa was the primary species affecting almonds in the Ebro Valley. Furthermore, early-stage mummified fruiting structures frequently adhered to branches (3.8 log conidia/mummified fruiting structure), whereas late-stage mummified fruiting structures were predominantly found on the ground. Additionally, cankers present before blooming (6.0 × 102 and 1.4 × 103 conidia/canker) served as primary inoculum sources. Inoculum incidence and concentration were significantly higher in late-stage fruits (50-100%, 8.5 × 103-2.5 × 105 conidia/plant organ) than those in flowers (20-30%, 2.0-4.0 × 103 conidia/plant organ) or those in postblooming cankers (1.0 × 102-1.8 × 103 conidia/canker). Infection dynamics of blossom blight in both orchards peaked during the last third of April under favorable meteorological conditions, specifically within the 10 days preceding the assessments. Significant correlations were found between infections progression and meteorological parameters, including temperature, relative humidity, rainfall and leaf wetness.
These findings provide critical insights into sustainable disease management practices and the optimal timing of protective measures against blossom blight. © 2025 The Author(s). Pest Management Science published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd on behalf of Society of Chemical Industry.</p>

<p>To identify the major barriers to and facilitators of implementing the Lebanese Health Economic Evaluation Guideline (LEEG) according to Lebanese stakeholders, supported by their insights.‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬.
We conducted a survey asking 16 key stakeholders to rate LEEG’s importance, its necessity for Lebanon, and its applicability in decision-making, and Likert scale questions to rate barriers and facilitators. Following the survey, an individual face-to-face interview using open-ended questions was arranged to validate the survey’s data, to collect further insights regarding LEEG’s implementation in Lebanon, and to identify relevant barriers and facilitators.
All participants considered LEEG to be very important for Lebanon. The majority considered it very important for decision-making, while there was some disagreement on the applicability of economic evaluation as a criterion for decision-making. The most important barriers were ‘lack of political willingness to adopt economic evaluation and use health technology assessment findings’ and ‘the absence of policy networks.’ The most important facilitators were ‘the strong need to implement national guidelines in Lebanon’ and ‘acceptability to payers.’
We reported on important barriers to and facilitators of implementing LEEG related to the national context and methodological concerns. This will pave the way for developing strategies essential for effective implementation and, consequently, a better healthcare system, advancing progress to universal health coverage.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-35">摘要</h3>
<p>Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) remains a major public health concern in Thailand, particularly in areas endemic for Opisthorchis viverrini infection. During the period of 2020-2022, there was a rapid shift in public communication behaviors that created new opportunities to promote health education through diverse media channels. This study aimed to assess public awareness of CCA prevention and explore the feasibility of applying social marketing strategies during a time of health crisis. A cross-sectional survey of 150 participants was conducted in high-risk communities of Sisaket Province using multi-stage sampling. Data were collected using a validated questionnaire evaluating awareness of CCA prevention after exposure to five media types: broadcast, print, signage, personal (village health volunteers), and online media. Feasibility was assessed using a 16-item scale based on the 4P’s marketing mix framework: product, price, place, and promotion. Descriptive statistics were conducted. Participants demonstrated high awareness across all media types, especially through online media (Facebook, Line), print media, and public signage. The feasibility of implementing social marketing strategies for education was rated high overall (mean = 4.26, SD = 0.14), with strong agreement in knowledge transfer and community participation. These findings underscore the potential of using multi-channel media and marketing principles to enhance public education and promote preventive behaviors for CCA. Importantly, the results provide insight into how such strategies may be adapted for other emerging diseases, where rapid and widespread public engagement is critical. Social marketing represents a promising tool for cancer education of the public, particularly in low-resource settings and during times of public health disruption.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-36">摘要</h3>
<p>This study investigated the cost-effectiveness of an early childhood obesity prevention intervention providing telephone and short message service (SMS) support to mothers of children aged 2-4 years by socioeconomic position (SEP).
A model-based SEP-specific economic evaluation of the intervention was conducted. SEP-specific intervention costs and effects at age 5 years were derived from the trial data and applied to a cohort of 4- to 5-year-old Australian children. We used the validated EQ-EPOCH microsimulation model to predict SEP-specific body mass index (BMI) trajectories, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and health care costs until 17 years of age. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and acceptability curves were derived for each SEP group, using 2023 Australian dollars (AUD).
From an Australian health payer perspective, the ICERs for the low-SEP group were $131 per BMI unit avoided and $6549 per QALY gained, compared to the high-SEP group at $1161 per BMI unit avoided and $41,462 per QALY gained. Results were robust to sensitivity analyses varying the intervention effect size, intervention costs, healthcare costs, discount rate and disutility from overweight. The probability that the intervention was cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY gained was extremely high in the low-SEP group (99.7%) and marginally cost-effective in the high-SEP group (49.6%).
A telephone and SMS intervention was more cost-effective in low-SEP groups compared with high-SEP groups. Prioritizing families from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds for this intervention will reduce healthy weight inequalities in childhood.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-37">摘要</h3>
<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) represents a growing global health burden, underscoring the urgent need for reliable diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Although several disease-modifying treatments have recently become available, their effects remain limited, as they primarily delay rather than halt disease progression. Thus, the early and accurate identification of individuals at elevated risk for conversion to AD dementia is crucial to maximize the effectiveness of these therapies and to facilitate timely intervention strategies. Baseline plasma concentrations of amyloid beta 40 (Aβ40), amyloid beta 42 (Aβ42), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light chain (NFL), and tau phosphorylated at residue 181 and 217 (pTau181, pTau217) were quantified in 233 non-demented participants from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and followed for up to 11 years. Covariates included demographic variables and neuropsychological measures. Longitudinal cognitive trajectories were modelled with linear mixed-effects models (LMM), and the risk of progression to AD dementia was evaluated with logistic regression and Cox proportional-hazards analyses. Longitudinally, higher baseline plasma levels of GFAP, NFL, pTau181, and pTau217 independently predicted steeper cognitive decline. Cross-sectional analyses demonstrated significant associations of pTau217, pTau181, and Aβ42 with baseline memory impairment. A logistic regression model incorporating five plasma biomarkers-Aβ42, GFAP, NFL, pTau181, and pTau217-demonstrated robust predictive accuracy for discrimination of future converters to AD dementia. The addition of demographic variables and a baseline memory score further improved model specificity and positive predictive value. These findings support the utility of a concise plasma biomarker panel comprising Aβ42, GFAP, NFL, pTau181, and pTau217 for predicting both longitudinal cognitive deterioration and conversion to AD dementia. This less-invasive blood-based panel could serve as a practical triage tool to enrich clinical trials and facilitate timely therapeutic interventions with emerging disease-modifying treatments.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-38">摘要</h3>
<p>Studies examining the association of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with cancer risk have demonstrated conflicting results.
This was an individual participant data meta-analysis including 54 international cohorts contributing to the CKD Prognosis Consortium. Included cohorts had data on albuminuria [urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR)], estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), overall and site-specific cancer incidence, and established risk factors for cancer. Included participants were aged 18 years or older, without previous cancer or kidney failure.
Among 1,319,308 individuals, the incidence rate of overall cancer was 17.3 per 1000 person-years. Higher ACR was positively associated with cancer risk [adjusted hazard ratio 1.08 (95% CI 1.06-1.10) per 8-fold increase in ACR]. No association of eGFR with overall cancer risk was seen. For site-specific cancers, lower eGFR was associated with urological cancer and multiple myeloma, whereas higher ACR was associated with many cancer types (kidney, head/neck, colorectal, liver, pancreas, bile duct, stomach, larynx, lung, hemolymphatic, leukaemia, and multiple myeloma). Results were similar in a 1-year landmark analysis.
Albuminuria, but not necessarily eGFR, was independently associated with the subsequent risk of cancer. Our results warrant an investigation into mechanisms that explain the link between albuminuria and cancer.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-39">摘要</h3>
<p>A plant-focused, healthy dietary pattern, such as the Mediterranean diet enriched with dietary fiber, polyphenols, and polyunsaturated fats, is well known to positively influence the gut microbiota. Conversely, a processed diet high in saturated fats and sugars negatively impacts gut diversity, potentially leading to weight gain, insulin resistance, and chronic, low-grade inflammation. Despite this understanding, the mechanisms by which the Mediterranean diet impacts the gut microbiota and its associated health benefits remain unclear.
This retrospective, observational study explored the relationships between Mediterranean dietary components-vegetables, fruits and nuts, legumes, whole grains, fish, meat, dairy, alcohol, saturated and unsaturated fats-and the gut microbiota in middle-aged adults enrolled in Alberta’s Tomorrow Project, Canada. Diet was recorded using the Canadian Dietary History Questionnaire (CDHQ-II) and participants were classified into four quartiles based on a modified Mediterranean Diet Score. Blood and fecal samples were collected for metabolomics and 16S rRNA sequencing, respectively.
Findings revealed that higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with increased alpha diversity and a greater abundance of beneficial fiber-degrading bacteria, including Prevotella, Parabacteroides, Clostridium XIVb, Coprobacter, and Turicibacter. Furthermore, participants who consumed more Mediterranean diet components exhibited higher concentrations of serum microbial metabolites including p-hydroxy hippuric acid and indole-acetaldehyde.
Results demonstrate a pivotal role of the gut microbiota, via its metabolites in harnessing the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet, highlighting its potential to promote metabolic health and prevent chronic disease.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-40">摘要</h3>
<p>Myocardial infarction (MI), induced by ischemia and hypoxia of the coronary arteries, presents as myocardial necrosis. Patients often experience intense, prolonged retrosternal pain that is unrelieved by rest or nitrate therapy and is frequently associated with high blood myocardial enzyme levels. Physical effort may exacerbate this anxiety, increasing the likelihood of life-threatening consequences such as arrhythmias, shock, or cardiac failure. Chrysin, a natural flavonoid primarily found in honey and propolis, exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, and antiviral properties. This study utilized MI models and various analytical techniques, including Western blotting, immunofluorescence, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and autodocking, to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the action of chrysin in molecular interactions. Our results demonstrated that Chrysin alleviates apoptosis in cardiomyocytes by decreasing the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and suppressing caspase-3 activation, actions facilitated by PPAR-γ activation and consequent overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins. Furthermore, chrysin mitigates cardiac fibrosis by downregulating TGF-β1, collagen I, and α-SMA expression. These effects markedly diminish infarct size and improve heart function in ischemia-reperfusion damage models, ascribed to chrysin’s activation of PPAR-γ and SIRT3, together with the regulation of β-catenin pathways. The preclinical data presented in this research establish a foundation for forthcoming clinical studies to assess the safety and effectiveness of chrysin in patients with myocardial infarction. This may facilitate the development of a novel treatment approach for treating MI.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-41">摘要</h3>
<p>Astaxanthin Z-isomers have attracted much attention because recent studies have demonstrated that they exhibit greater bioavailability and biological activity than the naturally predominant all-E-isomer. However, the plasma appearance and tissue distribution of astaxanthin isomers when administered with a diet rich in astaxanthin Z-isomers are largely unknown. To understand the health benefits and safety of astaxanthin Z-isomers, it is important to study the in vivo kinetics of the isomers.
Z-Isomer-enriched astaxanthin (the total Z-isomer ratio = 58.7%) esters derived from Haematococcus lacustris were fed to male rats, and the in vivo kinetics using single- and 14-day repeated-dose oral tests were investigated. In a single-dose study, (9Z)-astaxanthin appeared to be the fastest among the Z-isomers in the plasma, but its ratio decreased over time. In contrast, the 13Z-isomer in plasma gradually increased and became the most dominant Z-isomer 3 h after administration. After a 14-day repeated-dose oral test, astaxanthin isomers were detected in various tissues such as liver, prostate, and adipose tissues. The total Z-isomer ratio in the liver was the highest (61.1% ± 3.1%). The 13Z-isomer ratio was the highest in all tissues, and small amounts of 9Z-, 15Z-, and a few unknown Z-isomers were observed. The composition of the isomers differed greatly between tissues and diet (i.e., the most dominant Z-isomer in the diet was 9Z-isomer).
The absorption and accumulation efficiencies of astaxanthin differs between the Z-isomers, and several astaxanthin Z-isomers would be converted into other isomers or metabolites into other substances during the absorption and body circulation processes. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-42">摘要</h3>
<p>The three-dimensional (3D) culture system has emerged as an indispensable platform for modulating stem cell function in biomedicine, drug screening, and cell therapy. Despite a few studies confirming the functionality of 3D culture, the molecular factors underlying this process remain obscure. Here, we have utilized a hanging drop method to generate 3D spheroid-derived mesenchymal stem cells (3D MSCs) and compared them to conventionally 2D-cultured MSCs. The results showed that 3D MSCs exhibited distinct phenotypic features than 2D-cultured MSCs and expressed different transcriptional responses, as found from RNA-Seq analysis. Gene ontology (GO) annotations and KEGG pathway mapping pinpointed that the 3D MSCs responded more actively to incoming signals as they upregulated receptors and cytokine production while downregulating proteolysis-, cytoskeletal-, extracellular matrix-, and adhesion-related genes. Functionally, these MSCs also displayed enhanced chemotaxis and improved pulmonary transgression post-intravenous injection. This study provides mechanistic insights on addressing a significant limitation of MSC therapy: pulmonary entrapment after systemic delivery. Moreover, upregulated pluripotency-associated genes, such as Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog, suggest that the 3D MSCs possessed enhanced stemness and regenerative capacity. The results indicate that 3D spheroid culture reshapes MSC transcriptomic and functional profiles and emerges as a promising strategy for improving their therapeutic potential in regenerative medicine.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-43">摘要</h3>
<p>Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab (LP) therapy has emerged as an effective treatment for patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. However, limited data are available regarding its outcomes in real-world settings. This study aimed to identify prognostic factors associated with the efficacy of LP therapy.
This multicenter observational study was conducted across 15 institutions in Japan and examined patients with endometrial cancer, including uterine carcinosarcoma, who experienced disease progression after receiving at least one platinum-based chemotherapy, including adjuvant treatment, and subsequently received LP therapy. The prognostic factors for progression-free survival were assessed using a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model.
A total of 105 patients met the inclusion criteria. Improved progression-free survival was independently associated with performance status of 0 (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.23-0.75), platinum-free interval (PFI) of ≥ 6 months (aHR 0.46, 95% CI 0.28-0.78), histology of grade 1-2 endometrioid carcinoma (aHR 0.52, 95% CI 0.30-0.91), and relative dose intensity during the initial 8 weeks (8w-RDI) of lenvatinib of ≥ 50% (aHR 0.53, 95% CI 0.31-0.91). Patients with PFI of ≥ 6 months also demonstrated improved overall survival (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.25-0.76) and objective response rate (44.0% versus 20.0%, P = 0.011) compared with those with PFI of &lt; 6 months. Additionally, 8w-RDI of lenvatinib ≥ 50% was associated with improved overall survival (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.30-0.92) compared to those with &lt; 50%.
This study identified several novel prognostic factors for LP therapy. Among them, PFI may inform treatment selection for recurrent endometrial cancer following chemotherapy.

<h3 id="摘要-45">摘要</h3>
<p>Epigenetic processes, such as DNA methylation, show potential as biological markers and mechanisms underlying gene-environment interplay in the prediction of mental health and other brain-based phenotypes. However, little is known about how peripheral epigenetic patterns relate to individual differences in the brain itself. An increasingly popular approach to address this is by combining epigenetic and neuroimaging data; yet, research in this area is almost entirely comprised of cross-sectional studies in adults. To bridge this gap, we established the Methylation, Imaging and NeuroDevelopment (MIND) Consortium, which aims to bring a developmental focus to the emerging field of Neuroimaging Epigenetics by (i) promoting collaborative, adequately powered developmental research via multi-cohort analyses; (ii) increasing scientific rigor through the establishment of shared pipelines and open science practices; and (iii) advancing our understanding of DNA methylation-brain dynamics at different developmental periods (from birth to emerging adulthood), by leveraging data from prospective, longitudinal pediatric studies. MIND currently integrates 16 cohorts worldwide, comprising (repeated) measures of DNA methylation in peripheral tissues (blood, buccal cells, and saliva) and neuroimaging by magnetic resonance imaging across up to five time points over a period of up to 21 years (Npooled DNAm = 12,877; Npooled neuroimaging = 10,899; Npooled combined = 6074). By triangulating associations across multiple developmental time points and study types, we hope to generate new insights into the dynamic relationships between peripheral DNA methylation and the brain, and how these ultimately relate to neurodevelopmental and psychiatric phenotypes.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-46">摘要</h3>
<p>The neurological manifestations of SHORT syndrome include intrauterine growth restriction, microcephaly, intellectual disability, hearing loss, and speech delay. SHORT syndrome is generally believed to be caused by PIK3R1 gene mutations and impaired PI3K-AKT activation. Recently, a clinical case report described a SHORT syndrome with a novel mutant in PRKCE gene encoding protein kinase Cε (PKCε). However, it remains unclear whether the down-regulation of PKCε gives rise to the symptoms of SHORT syndrome. In this study, we show that a deficiency of PKCε in the central nervous system leads to cerebral and cerebellar atrophy, as well as motor and social deficits. Mechanistically, the deletion of PKCε results in the down-regulation of VEGF/PI3K-induced AKT activation, thereby causing abnormal brain development and dysfunctions. These findings emphasize the roles of PKCε in the development and function of the brain, and offer new perspectives for understanding the neurological manifestations of SHORT syndrome.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-47">摘要</h3>
<p>Obesity has been considered the pandemic of the 21st century due to its high prevalence and the significant morbidity and mortality it entails. The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of obesity in two occupational sectors and to determine the variables associated with it.
This is a cross-sectional and descriptive study involving 56,856 workers from the commerce and industrial sectors. Anthropometric, clinical, analytical, and sociodemographic data were collected during medical examinations conducted between 2017 and 2019.
The prevalence of obesity was found to be significantly higher in the industrial sector compared to the commerce sector. Factors such as age, sex, educational level, physical activity, adherence to the Mediterranean diet, and smoking showed significant associations with the four scales of excess weight evaluated. Among these, age, physical activity level, and adherence to the Mediterranean diet demonstrated the strongest associations. In the industrial sector, obesity may be related to work-related stress, prolonged shifts, and limited access to healthy food, whereas in the commerce sector, sedentary behaviour and poor dietary habits were identified as key contributing factors.
Specific strategies tailored to each occupational sector are recommended, including active breaks, the promotion of physical activity, and access to healthy foods. While the study has strengths such as its large sample size and multivariate analysis, the cross-sectional design and lack of control for certain confounding variables limit its ability to establish causality. The findings underscore the need for preventive policies adapted to workplace environments to mitigate the impact of obesity.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-48">摘要</h3>
<p>Chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology has been reported in Mesoamerican regions and other parts of the world, with increasing evidence pointing to heat stress as a central contributing factor. The incidence of acute kidney injury appears to correlate strongly with heat exposure, as demonstrated in both human and animal studies. The underlying mechanisms of heat-induced kidney injury are likely multifactorial, involving hemodynamic changes, immune responses, and possibly coagulopathies. However, the precise pathways remain unclear, highlighting the urgent need for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms and for developing strategies to prevent or mitigate renal damage. This is particularly important not only for heat-exposed occupational groups, such as agricultural workers, military personnel, and athletes, but also for the general population, who are increasingly vulnerable to extreme heat events every year.

<h3 id="摘要-49">摘要</h3>
<p>An accurate understanding of protein requirements helps prevent health risks caused by deficiency. No statistical comparison exists between the nitrogen balance (NB) method, the standard method for estimating protein requirements, and the indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO) method, which has been increasingly studied.
To quantitatively compare the protein requirements of the NB and IAAO methods through meta-analyses.
Studies estimating protein requirements in healthy individuals using the NB or IAAO methods were reviewed. First, previous reviews were systematically searched to identify original NB articles up to 2012 and IAAO articles up to 2023 from their references. Original articles published after each review’s search period, up to January 11, 2025, were systematically searched using PubMed and Ichushi-Web. Manual searches were performed through citation tracking of included literature and gray literature. This study followed PRISMA guidelines. Differences in protein requirements between assessment methods were compared using Welch’s t-test.
A total of 43 NB articles (777 participants) and 17 IAAO articles (186 participants) were included. In non-athletes, protein requirements were significantly higher by 36% with IAAO (mean: 0.88 g/kg/day; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.85, 0.90) than with NB (mean: 0.64 g/kg/day; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.68). In athletes, protein requirements were significantly higher by 27% with IAAO (mean: 1.61 g/kg/day; 95% CI: 1.44, 1.78) than with NB (mean: 1.27 g/kg/day; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.47). In non-athletes, IAAO values remained significantly higher than NB values across age and sex subgroups.
The protein requirements calculated using the IAAO method were approximately 30% higher than those obtained using the NB method. The quantitative findings of this study provide important information for scientific consideration of protein requirements.

<h3 id="摘要-50">摘要</h3>
<p>Human activities contribute to large shifts in the global climate, with far-reaching impacts on ecosystems, societies, and human health. Modern food systems-designed to produce convenience foods that tend to have high inflammatory potential-exacerbate environmental degradation and shape the interwoven challenges of climate, nutrition, and health. Over the past three decades, extreme weather has worsened and poor diets have led to more inflammation-related health problems-two parallel trends that are exposing system-wide weaknesses and harming global health. Is there evidence of a connection between environmental degradation and inflammation? The medical and environmental literatures were searched by combining “climate change” OR “environmental factors” OR “food systems” AND “inflammation” AND “diet”. All permutations of these terms were searched and all terms were searched as both text words and MeSH. The literature on inflammation and health is vast (≈750,000 articles in the National Library of Medicine [NLM]) as is the literature on diet and health (&gt;1.8 million articles in the NLM). Interest in global climate change is growing (≈39,000 references in the NLM and &gt;650,000 references in the Web of Science Core Collection). While the literature at the intersections of diet and inflammation with either climate change or, especially, food systems is small, evidence points to a connection between global climate changes and inflammation operating mainly through food systems. Large-scale industrialized agriculture and other environmental changes that are heating the planet produce food commodities that are causally related to inflammatory processes within organisms. The interplay between individuals’ dietary decisions and system-level decisions regarding food production and processing sets the stage for deepening understanding of connections revealed in the literature and developing a multifaceted approach to address these critical problems that encompass individual behavior change and collaborative initiatives across sectors to effect meaningful change. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: While scientific knowledge on: 1) diet, inflammation and health; 2) climate change; and 3) food systems are vast, there is virtually nothing written regarding how all three may be connected. We propose a connection between personal behaviors associated with diet, food systems, climate change, and inflammation as the major substrate for determining health in human populations.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-51">摘要</h3>
<p>Intimate partner domestic violence (IPDV) is a global health concern. We explored the association between IPDV and the subsequent onset of hazardous alcohol use among married men and women.
A total of 13,277 married adults were included in the analysis, with annual repeated measurements from 2009 to 2024, totaling 103,825 observations. Exposure to direct physical or emotional forms of IPDV in the past year served as the main exposure variable. Hazardous alcohol use was assessed using the 10-item Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). Lagged generalized estimating equation models were used to examine the association of IPDV exposure with the onset of hazardous alcohol use in the following year.
Of the participants, 80.8 % reported no experience of IPDV, 16.7 % experienced emotional IPDV, and 0.8 % experienced physical IPDV. Among men, compared with those with no exposure to IPDV, exposure by emotional and physical IPDV was associated with 1.31-fold (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1.14-1.51) and 2.95-fold (95 % CI: 1.76-4.94) increased risks for the onset of hazardous alcohol use the following year. Among women, compared with those with no exposure to IPDV, exposure by emotional and physical IPDV was associated with 1.37-fold (95 % CI: 0.94-2.01) and 5.64-fold (95 % CI: 2.74-11.64) increased risks for the onset of hazardous alcohol use.
The causal effects could not be asserted due to observational study design.
IPDV exposure was associated with the subsequent onset of hazardous alcohol use. Particularly, the association of physical IPDV exposure with hazardous alcohol use was stronger among female victims.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-52">摘要</h3>
<p>The effects of physical activity (PA), especially brisk walking, on labor outcomes and pregnancy health have not been clearly established. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between PA and cervical ripeness and pregnancy outcomes in term pregnant women.
A prospective cohort study was conducted with 52 pregnant women (30.7 ± 3.0 years old) at 37 weeks of gestation who wore accelerometers to measure PA until delivery. Their delivery outcomes and related clinical results were recorded. Participants were categorized into brisk walking ≥1 h group (AW group, n = 32) and brisk walking &lt;1 h group (BW group, n = 20) according to whether their average daily brisk walking time exceeded 1 h. Independent samples t-tests were used to compare the differences between groups, while the correlations between brisk walking duration and cervical ripeness, and pregnancy outcomes were analyzed using multi-factor logistic regression.
(1) Full-term pregnant women had an average daily sedentary time exceeding 9 h in late pregnancy (AW group: 9.7 ± 1.1 h/d, BW group: 10.2 ± 1.3 h/d). (2) Compared with the BW group, the AW group had significantly higher moderate-intensity physical activity time (1.5 ± 0.5 vs. 0.8 ± 0.2 h/d, P &lt; 0.001) and lower need for cervical ripening promotion (31.2 % vs. 50.0 %, P = 0.027). (3) Daily brisk walking duration was significantly and positively correlated with cervical ripening, with longer durations associated with more favorable cervical ripening (OR = 6.98, 95 % CI: 1.26-38.58, P = 0.026).
Brisk walking for ≥1 h per day in term pregnant women improves cervical ripening and reduces the need for artificial cervical ripening. These findings suggest that average daily brisk walking of at least 1 h before delivery may contribute to more favorable pregnancy outcomes in full-term pregnant women.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-53">摘要</h3>
<p>Remote services (in which the patient and staff member are not physically colocated) and digital services (in which a patient encounter is digitally mediated in some way) were introduced extensively when the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020. We undertook a longitudinal qualitative study of the introduction, embedding, evolution and abandonment of remote and digital innovations in United Kingdom general practice. This synoptic paper summarises study design, methods, key findings, outputs and impacts to date.
From September 2021 to December 2023, we collected &gt; 500 hours of ethnographic observation from a diverse sample of 12 general practices. Other data sources included over 200 interviews (with practice staff, patients and wider stakeholders), 4 multi-stakeholder workshops (184 participants), grey literature (e.g. Care Quality Commission reports) and safety incident reports. Patient involvement included digitally excluded individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds (e.g. homeless, complex needs). Data were de-identified, uploaded to NVivo (QSR International, Warrington, UK), coded thematically and analysed using various theoretical lenses. Despite an adverse context for general practice including austerity, workforce shortages, rising demand, rising workload and procurement challenges, all 12 participating practices adjusted to some extent to a ‘new normal’ of hybrid (combined traditional and remote/digital) provision following the external shock of the pandemic. By late 2023, practices showed wide variation in digital maturity from a ‘trailblazer’ practice which used digital technologies extensively and creatively to ‘strategically traditional’ practices offering mainly in-person services to deprived and vulnerable populations. We explained practices’ varied fortunes using diffusion of innovations theory, highlighting the extensive work needed to embed and routinise technologies and processes. Digitally enabled patients often, but not always, found remote and digital services convenient and navigable, but vulnerable groups experienced exclusion. We explored these inequities through the lenses of digital candidacy, fractured reflexivity and intersectionality. For staff, remote and digital tasks and processes were often complex, labour-intensive, stressful and dependent on positive interpersonal relations - findings that resonated with theories of technostress, suffering and relational co-ordination. Our initial plan for workshop-based co-design of access pathways with patients was unsuccessful due to dynamic complexities; shifting to a more bespoke and agile design process generated helpful resources for patients and staff.
This study has confirmed previous findings from sociotechnical research showing that new technologies are never ‘plug and play’ and that appropriate solutions vary with context. Much variation in digital provision in United Kingdom general practice reflects different practice priorities and population needs. However, some practices’ low digital maturity may indicate a need for additional resources, organisational support and strengthening of absorptive capacity. Negative impacts of digitalisation are common but not always inevitable; an ‘inefficient’ digital pathway may become more efficient over time as people adapt; and digitalisation does not affect all work processes equally (back-office tasks may be easier to routinise than clinical judgements). We have developed novel ways of involving patients from vulnerable and excluded groups, and have extended the evidence base on codesign for the busy and dynamic setting of general practice. Findings are being taken forward by national, locality-based and practice-level decision-makers; national regulators (e.g. in relation to safety); and educational providers for undergraduate, postgraduate and support staff (via a new set of competencies).
Ongoing and planned work to maximise impact from this study includes using our competency framework to inform training standards, pursuing our insights on quality and safety with policy-makers, a cross-country publication for policy-makers with examples from colleagues in other countries, resources to convey key messages to different audiences, and continuing speaking engagements for academic, policy and lay audiences.
The sampling of practices was limited to Great Britain. Patient interviews were relatively sparse. While the study generated rich qualitative data which was useful in its own right, a larger sample of practices with a quantitative component could support formal hypothesis-testing, and a health economics component could allow firmer statements about efficiency.
This synopsis presents independent research funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Health and Social Care Delivery Research programme as award number NIHR132807.
Before 2020, most general practice appointments were in-person. In March 2020, for infection control reasons, people had to phone or go online to seek appointments, and most consultations became remote (phone, video or electronic message). We studied how British general practices took these ‘disruptive innovations’ forward (or not). We used ethnography, where a researcher spends time in a practice observing and interviewing staff and patients. From mid-2021 to end 2023, we followed 12 practices (from small to large, basic to advanced technologically, and in affluent to deprived localities). We collected additional data from workshops, publicly available reports and wider interviews. We found that patients with digital devices and skills often found remote services convenient and easily navigable. But vulnerable groups – including poor, elderly, limited English speakers, refugees, and those with learning difficulties or complex health/social care needs – often struggled to access digital services (e.g. using websites or apps). By 2023, the 12 practices ranged from ‘strategically traditional’ (typically, serving populations with complex needs, for whom in-person services were often more appropriate) to a ‘digital trailblazer’ (making extensive use of digital tools and delivering &gt; 50% of consultations remotely). Digitalisation increased complexity of care. Staff reported stress (‘it feels like a call centre’), low confidence and unmet training needs. Almost all digital innovations required an extensive period of adjusting processes and pathways to fit the technology and vice versa. Measures to reduce inequities (e.g. training patients, digital navigators, walk-in services, low-tech options such as text messaging) sometimes helped. The prevailing context of austerity, workforce shortages, rising demand and need, and high workload made routinisation of digital innovations challenging. One size does not fit all. While some practices are appropriately high-tech, there are sometimes good reasons why others are not. Support for practices should focus on resourcing and optimising work processes to accommodate digital technologies, taking steps to reduce inequities of access, and ensuring staff competence and well-being.</p>
