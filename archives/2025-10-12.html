<h3 id="摘要">摘要</h3>
<p>Elastic Net regression successfully builds computational models to address complex biological systems such as protein-drug complexes. Here, we explain the Elastic Net regression method and its application to model a protein system. Among the open-source libraries with Elastic Net, we focus our studies on the Scikit-Learn implementation. This library has tens of regression methods, including the Elastic Net. We examine the program SAnDReS 2.0, an open-source program designed to build regression models to predict enzyme inhibition and describe an Elastic Net regression model to calculate the inhibition of a protein target based on the atomic coordinates obtained through docking simulations. Also, we introduce the scoring function concept and how to implement the Elastic Net to explore it. We discuss a regression model to predict the inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 2. Our regression model shows superior predictive performance compared with a classical scoring function. All Jupyter Notebooks examined here are at GitHub: https://github.com/azevedolab/docking#readme . The program SAnDReS 2.0 is available at https://github.com/azevedolab/sandres .</p>

<h3 id="摘要-1">摘要</h3>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) successfully integrates several emerging and established techniques to build models to address complex systems, including those from biological sources. In developing novel technologies to address protein-ligand interactions, AI showed relevant results for the structural modeling of protein targets (e.g., AlphaFold) and for building new scoring functions to address intermolecular interactions. Analysis of protein-ligand interactions is central to any docking screen project, and these AI developments have great potential to contribute to speeding up drug discovery and increasing the reliability of the computational methods employed to study intermolecular interactions. In this chapter, we present the Lasso regression method available in the program SAnDReS 2.0 and discuss its application to build a regression model to predict the inhibition of a protein target used in developing anticancer drugs. We explain the scoring function concept to get further insights into developing models to predict binding affinity. We focused our discussions on open-source software and freely accessible databases to build our regression models. Also, we made available all the codes discussed here at GitHub: https://github.com/azevedolab/docking#readme .</p>

<h3 id="摘要-2">摘要</h3>
<p>Docking screens rely on several computational techniques to analyze protein-ligand interactions. In this work, we focus on supervised machine learning. We discuss the application of linear regression using the program SAnDReS 2.0 to build a model to predict the inhibition of enzymes. Linear regression is a method to construct a supervised machine learning model based on a training dataset. This model considers parameters that minimize a cost function based on experimental information. The cost function captures the adequacy of the model and indicates how close the predicted values are to the experimental values. Linear regression belongs to a class of methods named parametric models. This simple approach is of general application to docking screens. We discuss its mathematical aspects and implementation using the Scikit-Learn library. We present a simple implementation of linear regression and its application to a toy dataset based on randomly generated data. Also, we discuss an application of this regression algorithm to study the inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 2. We developed a linear regression model using the program SAnDReS 2.0 to predict the inhibition of this enzyme. Additionally, we propose end-of-chapter exercises to improve understanding of the concepts discussed here. We made available all the codes discussed here at GitHub: https://github.com/azevedolab/docking#readme .</p>

<h2 id="article-4">4. The Current Status of Adult Patients With Urea Cycle Disorders in Japan: From the Nation-Wide Study.</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: Journal of inherited metabolic disease
<strong>发表日期</strong>: 2025-Nov
<strong>链接</strong>: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41074536">PubMed</a></p>

<h3 id="摘要-3">摘要</h3>
<p>Urea cycle disorders (UCDs) are rare inherited metabolic diseases characterized by defective detoxification of nitrogen, leading to hyperammonemia and neurological complications. While pediatric UCDs have been extensively studied in Japan, data on adult patients remain limited. This study aims to evaluate the current status of Japanese adult UCD patients, hereby comparing long-term outcomes after neonatal/infantile or late onset in a new nationwide study investigating clinical manifestations and management. In total, we collected data of 116 adult UCD patients diagnosed and/or treated at various institutions, combining this new cohort (34 UCD patients between January 2010 and December 2022) with data from a previous nationwide study (82 UCD patients between January 2000 and March 2018). Among 116 adult UCD patients, ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency was the most common subtype (N = 69). Hyperammonemia occurred in 91.4% of patients, and intellectual disability was present in 50.0%. Patients generally showed reduced final height and BMI compared to Japanese controls, particularly among females and those with infantile-onset UCDs. Peak ammonia levels ≥ 360 μmol/L were significantly associated with intellectual disability. Liver transplantation (LT) was performed in 20 patients, and although it helped to avoid hyperammonemia, it did not statistically improve neurocognitive outcomes in patients with peak ammonia &lt; 360 μmol/L. This study provides the first comprehensive overview of adult UCD patients in Japan, highlighting frequent growth impairment and variable cognitive outcomes. LT improves metabolic control but cannot prevent intellectual disability in all patients. These findings underscore the need for early diagnosis, individualized treatment strategies, and long-term follow-up into adulthood.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-4">摘要</h3>
<p>Currently, calcium deficiency and osteoporosis are public health issues worldwide. This study was aimed to evaluate the effects of yeast protein (YP) on calcium absorption and bone formation in rats fed by normal and low-calcium diets. The results showed that YP could significantly improve serum calcium and alkaline phosphatase (AKP) levels, apparent calcium absorption and retention rate, bone calcium content and bone biomechanical properties of rats fed normal diet (P &lt; 0.05). In the calcium-deficient rat model, intestinal calcium absorption, bone length, bone mechanical strength, bone calcium content and markers of bone formation were significantly improved by the dietary intervention of YP + CaCO3 (P &lt; 0.05). YP primarily relies on its good in vitro calcium chelation and in vivo calcium sustained release to promote calcium absorption and bone synthesis. Overall, YP as a dietary factor could effectively improve calcium absorption and bone synthesis.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-5">摘要</h3>
<p>Classical leptomeningeal disease (cLMD) impacts the entire craniospinal axis, but isolated parenchymal metastases sometimes display focal leptomeningeal extension (fLME) without diffuse LMD elsewhere. We assessed whether patients with fLME can be managed with stereotactic radiation (SRS/SRT) as opposed to whole brain / craniospinal radiation without excess development of marginal recurrences or subsequent cLMD.
We identified 796 patients with 2,354 newly-diagnosed brain metastases (BrM) without cLMD at diagnosis managed at a tertiary center between 2007-2022. Each metastasis was assessed for fLME, defined as isolated leptomeningeal extension of an intact BrM without cytologic or radiographic evidence of cLMD. Multivariable Fine and Gray’s models were constructed for the primary outcomes of local recurrence and cLMD development.
Among 796 patients, 138 (17.3%) displayed evidence of fLME, corresponding to 185 of 2,354 (7.9%) BrM. Patients with versus without fLME did not display excess local recurrences (1-year rate: 4.5% vs. 8.2%, respectively, p = 0.14; multivariable HR 0.56 [95% CI 0.30-1.07], p = 0.08), including in lesions managed with SRS/SRT (1-year rate: 4.4% vs. 4.9%, respectively; p = 0.63; multivariable HR 1.21 [95% CI 0.58-2.50], p = 0.61). The presence of fLME was not a significant predictor of subsequent cLMD (1-year rate: 5.2% vs 5.2%, p = 0.99; multivariable HR 0.87 [95% CI 0.44-1.71], p = 0.68), including following treatment with SRS/SRT (1-year rate: 6.2% vs. 4.1%, p = 0.83; multivariable HR 0.92 [95% CI 0.36-2.39], p = 0.87).
We describe a novel entity, fLME, which displays patterns of intracranial failure similar to parenchymal BrM. Stereotactic approaches may be viable in this population.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-6">摘要</h3>
<p>Today, technologies described as artificial intelligence (AI) impact older adults in numerous and diverse ways, yet the field of gerontology has not seriously engaged AI governance. From algorithmic decision making used in health insurance, employment, housing, and public benefits, to the information ecosystem, to AI companions, AI applications implicate important issues of ethics, service access, and ageism. Policy levers could help address these issues and mitigate harm, but there is currently a paucity of federal AI regulations. As AI and algorithmic harms are better understood, the call from public interest groups and researchers in various fields has gotten louder for comprehensive AI and data privacy policy in the United States. Yet there has been little attention on how rapid development and deployment of AI may affect older adults, and their diverse interests are not well represented in discourses about AI policy making or governance. Drawing on a narrative synthesis of academic and policy literature and attending to the principles in the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, we explain how these principles can guide the development of ethical governance of AI to ensure accountable development and implementation to promote the interests of older adults.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-7">摘要</h3>
<p>Prenatal oral care is a huge concern due to hormonal changes women undergo during pregnancy, during which pregnant women become susceptible to many oral diseases, such as periodontal disease. Disparities in oral health often affect women who fall into these categories: low-income, uninsured, and minority ethnic/racial groups. Having limited knowledge and a lack of access are significant contributing factors to the adverse effects of pregnancies. This qualitative phenomenological study aims to understand the perspectives of pregnant Black women and dental health care providers with oral health knowledge, oral health practices, insurance, and dental visits. Additionally, it offers perspectives of health care providers and minority pregnant women on how improvements to their dental care and hygiene can be enhanced.
A purposive sample of 10 participants, including five prenatal Black women and five health/dental providers, was recruited from New Orleans Public Health members and national medical and dental school networks. Qualitative data were collected through open-ended Zoom interviews with five Black women who were pregnant during 2020- 2022, and with five practicing physicians and dentists. Understanding why oral diseases affect this underserved population at high rates can help improve the practices in place.
Overall themes of concern were oral health education, additional oral health training for health care providers, including cultural competencies, and improved insurance practices.
Findings suggest increasing educational awareness for health care providers and Black pregnant women can help reduce oral diseases, while enhancing insurance practices can give this underserved population a holistic care approach.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-8">摘要</h3>
<p>Since the lifting of COVID-19 control measures, infections by common respiratory pathogens have emerged as a public health issue, and the impacts on vulnerable children with wheezing illnesses remain uncertain.
This prospective study enrolled children (&lt; 18 years) hospitalized for wheezing disorders in Hong Kong (2016‒2025). Nasopharyngeal aspirates collected within 12 h of admission were tested via rapid antigen detection, viral culture, and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for respiratory viruses. Bacterial pathogens were identified through cultures of blood/airway specimens or PCR, including Chlamydia pneumonia and mycoplasma pneumoniae detection via PCR.
A total of 2499 children [66.8% male, median age 2.9 (3.6) years)] with 3272 admissions due to wheezing disorders were identified. There was a substantial reduction in pediatric wheezing admissions during the COVID-19 pandemic (February 2020 to January 2023) compared to the pre-pandemic period (September 2016 to January 2020). After removing pandemic restrictions, wheezing admissions drastically increased from February 2023 to February 2025, exceeding the pre-pandemic level. A fivefold increase was observed in admissions due to “bronchiolitis” compared with that during the pandemic period (P &lt; 0.001). The post-pandemic proportion of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) significantly increased, especially among those under 5 years of age (P &lt; 0.01). Coinfections with multiple pathogens were more common during and after the pandemic than pre-pandemic (P &lt; 0.05).
Lifting restrictions led to a resurgence of wheezing admissions and respiratory infections. Continued pathogen monitoring in the post-pandemic era is crucial, and preventive measures for future health crises are needed.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-9">摘要</h3>
<p>Physical dysfunction is a preclinical stage of disability in older adults, linked to severe adverse outcomes such as death and hospitalization. Maximal tubular reabsorption of phosphate (TmP/GFR), as a key biomarker of phosphate metabolism, may be related to physical dysfunction, but this relationship has not yet been explored.
Using data from the Rugao Longitudinal Ageing Study (RLAS), longitudinal logistic regression was employed to explore the relationship between abnormal TmP/GFR and physical dysfunction. For validation, the UK Biobank dataset was combined, and mendelian randomization (MR) was conducted to investigate causality. The maximal phosphate reabsorption was assessed using TmP/GFR, while physical dysfunction were evaluated through grip strength and the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test.
During the four-year follow-up, 89 (13.55%) and 279 (40.85%) participants were identified as having a new onset of decreased grip and TUG. The abnormal TmP/GFR population had a significantly higher risk of decreased grip (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.20-3.49) and decreased TUG (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.05-2.12). MR analysis demonstrated the causal effect of TmP/GFR dysfunction population had significantly lower grip and lower walking speed.
This study first identifies abnormal TmP/GFR as a novel biomarker of physical dysfunction in older adults. Additionally, its causal relationship further substantiates the reliability of this finding. Abnormal TmP/GFR enables early detection of physical dysfunction, facilitating the prevention of severe adverse outcomes.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-10">摘要</h3>
<p>Incretin-based therapies, including glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4Is), are widely used in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, concerns have emerged regarding their potential association with an increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), and current evidence remains inconclusive. This review aims to evaluate and clarify the association between incretin-based therapies and the risk of CCA in patients with T2DM.
This review followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines and was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42025641616). A comprehensive search was performed across PubMed, ProQuest, EBSCOhost, Wiley, and SAGE databases. Eligible observational studies reporting the association between incretin-based therapies and CCA were included. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using RevMan with a random-effects model.
Four studies (three cohort and one case-control) were included. The pooled HRs showed no significant association between incretin-based therapies and CCA risk, with estimates of 1.07 (95% CI: 0.70-1.63) for GLP-1RAs and 1.05 (95% CI: 0.83-1.34) for DPP-4Is. Pooled RR analyses yielded similarly non-significant results. All included studies were assessed as having a low risk of bias according to the NOS.
Incretin-based therapies do not significantly increase the risk of CCA in T2DM patients. Within the limitations of the available observational evidence, these findings provide reassurance regarding their safety profile, while highlighting the need for ongoing pharmacovigilance and further large-scale studies to confirm these results.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-11">摘要</h3>
<p>Industrialization, urbanization, and poor farming practices have led to major problems regarding potentially toxic elements (PTEs). PTEs in industrial effluents adversely affect water quality, soil, plants, and aquatic life, and ultimately cause severe health problems in humans. Several strategies have been utilized to overcome this serious environmental issue. The conventional methods most commonly used for this purpose are expensive and not environmentally friendly. Phytoremediation is a very cost-effective and eco-friendly strategy where researchers are focusing their efforts nowadays. This technique utilizes plants to remove PTEs from the soil. The efficacy of phytoremediation is enhanced by the microorganisms in the rhizosphere, where microbes utilize root exudates as their energy source, which in turn remove or solubilize PTEs from the soil. Microbes have adopted several mechanisms that directly and/or indirectly assist plants in resisting PTE stress. These mechanisms include biosorption, bioaccumulation, efflux systems, enzymatic detoxification, siderophore production, biosurfactants, extracellular sequestration, intracellular sequestration, ACC-deaminase, IAA production, and phytohormone production. Plant-microbe interaction is one of the most successful approaches that not only aids in remediating PTEs from the soil but also assists plant development. The efficiency of microbial activity could be enhanced by inserting PTE resistance genes so that genetically engineered microbes (GEMs) work more efficiently to remove PTEs from soil or water. The current review addresses the deleterious effects of PTEs on living organisms and discusses possible cost-effective and eco-friendly microbial-assisted phytoremediation strategies to remove PTEs from soil contaminated with industrial effluents.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-12">摘要</h3>
<p>Social relationships play an important role in maintaining physical and psychological health. Epigenetic age is a potential mechanism underlying health-related aspects of social relationships. We aimed to assess the cross-sectional and prospective associations of social relationships and epigenetic age in middle-aged and older adults.
Blood DNA methylation data were collected from 6,208 participants in the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study at baseline (1990-1994, mean age = 59) and 1,110 at follow-up (2003-2007, mean age = 69). Four epigenetic ageing measures were considered: PCPhenoAge, PCGrimAge, bAge, and DunedinPACE. Social relationship variables were collected via self-reported questionnaires at baseline, including social activities, living arrangements, marital status, and numbers of close relatives and friends. A social isolation index was calculated. Linear regression was used to assess the associations of social relationships with baseline and follow-up epigenetic age.
Cross-sectionally, living alone and overall social isolation were associated with older epigenetic age in men only (e.g., living alone, DunedinPACE, per SD β  =  0.20, 95%CI: 0.10-0.29), with strong evidence of effect modification by sex (p = 0.002 to 4 × 10-5). Moderate amounts of social activities and a greater number of relatives and friends were also associated with a younger epigenetic age. Generally weaker associations were observed in prospective analyses.
In middle-aged and older Australians, positive components of social relationships showed weak associations with lower epigenetic age. Social isolation and living alone were associated with older epigenetic age only in men. Our study suggests that the benefits of social relationships to health are partially captured by epigenetic markers of ageing.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-13">摘要</h3>
<p>The San Francisco health department released guidelines on doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (doxy-PEP) for sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention in October 2022. Guidelines recommended doxy-PEP for transgender women (hereafter trans women) and men who have sex with men with a history of bacterial STI and condomless anal or oral sex in the last year. We assessed doxy-PEP awareness and use among trans women in San Francisco using National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) data from July 2023-May 2024, spanning 9-19 months after guideline release. In-person interviews recorded demographics, behaviors, HIV serostatus, STI history, and doxy-PEP awareness, discussion with a provider, and use in the last year. Among 339 trans women surveyed, 37% were aware of doxy-PEP. In the last year, 20% discussed doxy-PEP with a provider and 11% used doxy-PEP. Among trans women not living with HIV, awareness was correlated with age under 50 years (AOR 3.86, CI 1.92-7.74), engaging in sex work (AOR 1.85, 95% CI 1.02-3.38), and testing positive for a bacterial STI (AOR 2.92, 95% CI 1.35-6.33). Among those living with HIV, awareness of doxy-PEP was correlated with testing positive for an STI (OR 3.05, 95% CI 1.22-7.64). Despite efficacy demonstrated for trans women in clinical trials and health department guidelines prioritizing doxy-PEP for trans women, awareness of this effective STI prevention method was low. These findings mirror the experience with HIV PrEP roll-out for trans women. Targeted interventions and differentiated delivery models are needed to improve access, engagement, and uptake in this population.
El departamento de salud de San Francisco publicó directrices sobre la profilaxis posexposición con doxiciclina (doxy-PEP) para la prevención de infecciones de transmisión sexual (ITS) en octubre de 2022. Las directrices recomendaron doxy-PEP para mujeres trans y hombres que tienen sexo con hombres con antecedentes de ITS bacteriana y sexo anal o oral sin condón en el último año. Evaluamos el conocimiento y uso de doxy-PEP entre mujeres transgénero en San Francisco utilizando datos de la Vigilancia Nacional del Comportamiento del VIH (NHBS) desde julio de 2023 hasta mayo de 2024, abarcando de 9 a 19 meses después de la publicación de las directrices. Las entrevistas presenciales registraron datos demográficos, comportamientos, estado serológico frente al VIH, historial de ITS y conocimiento, discusión con un proveedor y uso de doxy-PEP en el último año. Entre las 339 mujeres trans encuestadas, el 37% conocía doxy-PEP. En el último año, el 20% discutió sobre doxy-PEP con un proveedor y el 11% usó doxy-PEP en el año anterior. Entre las mujeres trans que no viven con el VIH, el conocimiento se correlacionó con tener menos de 50 años (ORa 3.86, IC 1.92–7.74), ejercer el trabajo sexual (ORa 1.85, IC 95% 1.02–3.38), y haber dado positivo para una ITS bacteriana (ORa 2.92, IC 95% 1.35–6.33). Entre aquellas que viven con el VIH, el conocimiento de doxy-PEP se correlacionó con haber dado positivo para una ITS (OR 3.05, IC 95% 1.22–7.64). A pesar de la eficacia demostrada para mujeres trans en ensayos clínicos y de las directrices del departamento de salud que priorizan doxy-PEP para mujeres trans, el conocimiento de este método eficaz de prevención de ITS fue bajo. Estos hallazgos reflejan la experiencia con la implementación de la PrEP para el VIH entre mujeres trans. Se necesitan intervenciones específicas y modelos de entrega diferenciados para mejorar el acceso, la participación y el uso en esta población.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-14">摘要</h3>
<p>New HIV diagnoses among men who have sex with men (MSM) in San Francisco decreased by 77% from 2012 to 2021, presenting an encouraging trajectory toward zero infections by 2030. Unfortunately, the trajectory has slowed in recent years, with an uptick in new diagnoses from 2021 to 2022. We assessed the current HIV epidemic status and progress towards achieving the 95-95-95 HIV care continuum and prevention targets among MSM in San Francisco. Time-location sampling was used to sample MSM, recruiting at physical and online venues at randomly chosen venue-day-time periods from June to November 2023. HIV status was obtained by rapid testing; HIV care and prevention engagement were self-reported. Among 545 MSM, HIV prevalence was 24.4%. Prevalence was highest (48.8%) among Black/African American MSM. Of 132 living with HIV, 97.7% were aware of their status, of whom 97.7% were on antiretroviral therapy (ART), of whom 90.5% reported being virally suppressed. Among MSM not living with HIV, 80.0% had an HIV test, 56.5% used pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), 27.9% consistently used condoms, and 9.2% used post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in the past 12 months. MSM in San Francisco in 2023 exceeded the first (status awareness) and second (ART use) pillars of the shared global 95-95-95 targets, and was greater than 90% for the third (viral suppression). Our current prevention tools are reaching diminishing returns. New medical interventions may also have a marginal impact unless we first address social and structural barriers that continue to result in HIV disparities and PrEP inequities.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-15">摘要</h3>
<p>Adults with certain comorbidities, including metabolic and cardiopulmonary diseases, are at increased risk of severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of adjuvanted RSVPreF3 vaccination in adults in the USA aged 50-59 years at increased risk of severe RSV.
A Markov model with a 5-year time horizon estimated health and cost outcomes associated with adjuvanted RSVPreF3 vaccination in 3,259,715 adults aged 50-59 years with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) from a societal perspective, compared with no vaccination. Inputs related to epidemiology, vaccine efficacy, and demographics came from published literature and public sources; assumptions, when needed, relied on expert consultation. A 46.2% vaccine uptake was assumed, on the basis of influenza vaccination. We reported incremental public health impact, costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Scenario analyses investigated outcomes in adults aged 50-59 years with heart failure (HF), coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes, or asthma.
Over a 5-year time horizon, one-time adjuvanted RSVPreF3 vaccination of 1,505,989 adults aged 50-59 years with COPD was projected to prevent 163,181 RSV acute respiratory illness cases, 126,565 lower respiratory tract disease cases, 11,609 RSV-related hospitalizations, 4117 emergency department visits, 816 deaths, and 12,144 QALY losses, compared with no vaccination. Adjuvanted RSVPreF3 vaccination was a cost-saving strategy (i.e., dominant) versus no vaccination in US adults aged 50-59 years with the modeled comorbidities, reducing societal costs and improving health outcomes in each scenario.
In US adults aged 50-59 years at increased risk of severe RSV, a single dose of adjuvanted RSVPreF3 vaccination was projected to improve public health outcomes at a lower societal cost compared with no vaccination. Efforts are needed to ensure access to vaccination for populations at increased risk of severe RSV disease.
Adults with certain comorbidities, including metabolic and cardiopulmonary diseases, are at increased risk of severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of adjuvanted RSVPreF3 vaccination in adults in the USA aged 50–59 years at increased risk of severe RSV. Health and cost outcomes associated with adjuvanted RSVPreF3 vaccination were modeled over a 5-year time horizon for about 3.3 million adults aged 50–59 years with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease from a societal perspective, compared with no vaccination. Inputs came from published literature and public sources; assumptions, when needed, relied on expert consultation. Scenario analyses investigated outcomes in adults aged 50–59 years with heart failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes, or asthma. Over a 5-year time horizon, one-time adjuvanted RSVPreF3 vaccination of about 1.5 million adults aged 50–59 years with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was projected to prevent &gt; 160,000 RSV acute respiratory illness cases, &gt; 126,000 lower respiratory tract disease cases, &gt; 11,600 RSV-related hospitalizations, &gt; 4000 emergency department visits, and 816 deaths, compared with no vaccination. Adjuvanted RSVPreF3 vaccination reduced costs and improved health outcomes compared with no vaccination in US adults aged 50–59 years with the modeled comorbidities. Efforts are needed to ensure access to vaccination for populations at increased risk of severe RSV disease.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-16">摘要</h3>
<p>Global population aging is increasing the demand for Long-Term Care Facilities to support older adults with complex health needs. The Prescription Day LTCFs project is a national multicenter point-prevalence study, conducted by the Italian Society of Gerontology and Geriatrics in collaboration with the ANASTE Humanitas Foundation, investigated medication prescription patterns and administration practices in 3,400 residents across 82 facilities in Italy. Participants had a mean age of 84.7 years, with a high prevalence of frailty (49.7%) and polypharmacy (84.8% taking five or more medications). Common chronic conditions included hypertension, dementia, and dysphagia. The study highlighted the complexity of pharmacological regimens, emphasizing risks related to potentially inappropriate medications, drug-drug interactions, and frequent modifications of solid oral dosage forms to facilitate administration in residents with swallowing difficulties or cognitive impairment. These complexities contribute to increased nursing workload. Despite advances in deprescribing research, polypharmacy remains highly prevalent, underlining the need for tailored prescribing guidelines. Variability among Long Term Care Facilities reflects differences in organization and regional healthcare frameworks. The findings provide a valuable foundation for developing strategies to optimize medication management, enhance safety, and improve quality of care in Italian Long Term Care Facilities. This study also offers insights to inform healthcare policies and best practices in pharmacological care for older adults in Long Term Care settings.

<h3 id="摘要-17">摘要</h3>
<p>Dynapenic abdominal obesity (DAO) is a health indicator associating with aging-related disease in older adults. However, no research has clarified the impact of DAO on cardiovascular diseases (CVD). We aim to investigate the distribution of DAO status and its association with subsequent CVD in middle-aged and older adults.
Data were derived from 2011 to 2018 in China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study. The participants were classified as dynapenic abdominal obesity (D/AO), dynapenic non-abdominal obesity (D/NAO), non-dynapenic abdominal obesity (ND/AO) and non-dynapenic non-abdominal obesity (ND/NAO) based on waist circumference (≥ 90 cm for men or ≥ 85 cm for women) and handgrip strength (&lt;28 kg for men or &lt;18 kg for women). CVD was confirmed by medical diagnosis including heart diseases and stroke. Cox proportional hazards regression models were conducted to examine the effect of different DAO status on CVD.
Among 9150 participants without CVD history, ND/NAO, ND/AO, D/NAO and D/AO accounted for 51.92%, 35.55%, 8.46% and 4.07%, respectively. D/AO (HR 1.63, 95% CI: 1.21-2.20) and ND/AO (HR 1.56, 95% CI: 1.33-1.84) individuals had higher risk of CVD compared to ND/NAO participants. The association between D/AO and ND/AO and risk of CVD were more significant in people less than 65 years old (P = 0.044).
D/AO and ND/AO were both associated with higher risk of CVD among middle-aged and older adults, which was more pronounced in people younger than 65 years old. The presence of dynapenia further increased the risk of CVD in individuals with AO.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-18">摘要</h3>
<p>The comparative effectiveness of da Vinci robot-assisted versus conventional laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication for gastroesophageal reflux disease remains controversial despite increasing adoption of robotic platforms. Previous meta-analyses have yielded conflicting results regarding patient-centered outcomes and long-term durability. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing da Vinci-assisted versus conventional laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. This review was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD420251139110). We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and grey literature sources through August 2025. Primary outcomes included postoperative dysphagia, proton pump inhibitor use, and intraoperative complications. Secondary outcomes encompassed reoperation rates, operative time, length of stay, and conversion to open surgery. Risk ratios and mean differences were calculated using random-effects models. Evidence certainty was assessed using the GRADE methodology. Four randomized controlled trials involving 160 patients (79 robotic, 81 conventional laparoscopic) met the inclusion criteria. No significant differences were observed in early dysphagia (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.45-2.45), postoperative proton pump inhibitor use (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.25-3.79), or intraoperative complications (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.07-2.81). Secondary outcomes showed no differences in reoperation rates (RR 1.65, 95% CI 0.40-6.90), length of hospital stay (MD -0.03 days, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.36), or conversion rates (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.19-7.99). Operative time demonstrated substantial heterogeneity; sensitivity analysis revealed significantly longer times with robotics when one outlier study was removed (MD 40.28 min, p &lt; 0.00001). Da Vinci robot-assisted and conventional laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication achieve equivalent clinical outcomes with no significant differences in patient-reported outcomes, complications, or long-term effectiveness, while robotic procedures consistently require longer operative times and substantially higher costs without demonstrable clinical benefits. These findings question the routine application of robotic platforms in antireflux surgery until cost-effectiveness and operative efficiency are optimized.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-19">摘要</h3>
<p>The da Vinci robotic platform, as the earliest operative platform implemented in routine clinical use, has been employed for various complex surgical conditions owing to its precision in manipulation. However, its prohibitive costs have restricted widespread adoption in certain regions. Consequently, China’s domestically developed KangDuo robotic surgical platform was developed to address this need. Currently, comparative studies on perioperative outcomes between these two platforms for performing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) remain scarce. This meta-analysis aims to systematically compare perioperative outcomes among these robotic platforms. A structured search of the literature was undertaken across several principal online databases-such as PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and SpringerLink-to locate prospective investigations comparing K-RARP with D-RARP published before August 1, 2025. The comparative outcomes across the two robotic systems consisted of total operating time, estimated intraoperative blood loss, length of hospitalization, urinary continence recovery, post-operative complications, and positive surgical margin rates. This quantitative synthesis included four comparative studies encompassing an aggregate of 188 participants. The results revealed no significant differences in PSM rates (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.55-2.04; p = 0.86), estimated intraoperative blood loss (WMD - 1.04 ml, 95% CI - 21.72 to 19.63; p = 0.92), length of hospitalization (WMD - 0.32 days, 95% CI - 1.33 to 0.70; p = 0.54), urinary continence (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.50-1.83; p = 0.90), when contrasting K-RARP with D-RARP. Moreover, no meaningful differences were detected in the incidence of Clavien-Dindo grade I complications (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.33-3.89; p = 0.84), grade II complications (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.39-3.18; p = 0.84), or overall complication incidence (OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.59-2.76; p = 0.53). However, for K-RARP, operative duration was significantly longer (WMD 41.34 min, 95% CI 22.42-60.26; p &lt; 0.05). As the inaugural comparative assessment of perioperative outcomes between KangDuo and da Vinci robotic systems, this study demonstrated that while K-RARP required significantly longer operative times, it achieved comparable outcomes to D-RARP in EBL, positive surgical margin rate, hospital stay, continence, and complication rates. This evidence positions the KangDuo platform as a viable future option for localized prostate cancer management. However, this conclusion remains preliminary and exploratory, and will need to be confirmed through large-scale, multicenter, multi-regional randomized controlled trials combined with long-term follow-up.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-20">摘要</h3>
<p>Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a respiratory disorder characterized by recurrent pauses in breathing during sleep and is responsible for serious cardiovascular and metabolic complications. Although its prevalence has been rising in parallel with the increasing obesity rates among young people, OSAS remains markedly underdiagnosed. In Vietnam, OSAS was only formally recognized and diagnosed within the past ten years, and it was introduced into the undergraduate curriculum at Hanoi Medical University just two years ago; consequently, both clinical awareness and attitudes toward this condition are still limited.
This study aims to determine the proportion of students at Hanoi Medical University (HMU) who are at risk of OSAS and to analyze the clinical characteristics of those identified as high-risk.
A cross-sectional study was conducted on 135 HMU students between June 15 and September 15, 2024. We assessed OSAS risk using three versions of the STOP-BANG questionnaire (original, Asian, and Vietnamese-adapted “VietSBQ”), with body mass index (BMI) thresholds modified for the local population.
According to the original STOP-BANG scale, 8.1% of students were classified as having an intermediate-to-high risk of OSAS, whereas the VietSBQ identified 17.0% as high-risk. The prevalence of obesity differed significantly between high-risk groups: 9.1% by the original scale versus 65.2% by VietSBQ (p &lt; 0.005). Among students at high risk, the predominant factors were male sex (95.7%), excessive daytime sleepiness (73.9%), and BMI &gt; 25 kg/m² (65.2%).
The Vietnamese-adapted STOP-BANG questionnaire enhances the detection of OSAS risk in Vietnamese young adults. Given the recent introduction of OSAS into both clinical practice and medical education in Vietnam, particular attention should be paid to male students, those reporting daytime somnolence alongside snoring or witnessed apneas, and individuals with elevated BMI to facilitate early identification and intervention.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-22">摘要</h3>
<p>Antimicrobial resistance poses a growing global health threat and is largely driven by the inappropriate use of antibiotics. Primary healthcare institutions, particularly in low-resource settings, often face challenges, such as limited oversight and irrational prescribing practices. While progress has been made in improving antibiotic stewardship in higher-level hospitals, efforts to optimize prescription in primary healthcare institutions remain insufficient. The County Medical Community Central Pharmacy (CMCP) program was introduced as an integrated intervention to enhance pharmacy services and promote rational antibiotic use through centralized oversight, training, and pharmacist collaboration.
This multicenter quasi-experimental study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the CMCP program in reducing antibiotic misuse and improving prescribing rationality in primary healthcare institutions in Shandong Province, China.
This multicenter quasi-experimental study was conducted between July and December 2023 in six geographically and economically diverse rural regions of Shandong Province. A total of 37 primary healthcare institutions were included, with 25 voluntarily implementing the CMCP program (intervention group) and 12 continuing routine practices (control group). Data were collected at two time points via structured questionnaires and reviews of 100 randomly selected outpatient prescriptions from each primary healthcare institution. A difference-in-differences (DID) regression model was applied to estimate the impact of the intervention on antibiotic usage and irrational prescribing, controlling for institutional and staffing characteristics.
Antibiotic usage rates increased in both groups, but to a lesser extent in the intervention group (from 15.726 to 18.732%; P = 0.006) than in the control group (from 17.682 to 26.582%; P &lt; 0.001). DID analysis showed a mitigating effect on antibiotic use (DID coefficient = - 0.061; P = 0.054). Irrational antibiotic use in the intervention group decreased from 50.660 to 27.655% (P &lt; 0.001), whereas it remained largely unchanged in the control group (36.893% vs. 35.238%).
The CMCP program was effective in curbing unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions and enhancing prescription quality in primary healthcare institutions. These findings support the continued implementation and scale-up of CMCP as a strategy to strengthen antibiotic stewardship at the primary care level in resource-limited settings.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-24">摘要</h3>
<p>The aim of this study was to identify shared and distinct metabolite profiles prospectively associated with nephropathy, retinopathy and neuropathy at 15 years’ follow-up among 1947 participants in the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study, the long-term follow-up of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP).
We applied bootstrapped LASSO to 353 annotated metabolites to identify metabolites associated with one or more complication. For these metabolite hits, we tested for an interaction with DPP treatment arm, and ran multivariable models for the pooled sample or within treatment group as appropriate.
At follow-up, 572 participants had one or more complication (n=277 nephropathy, n=194 retinopathy, n=212 neuropathy). Of 105 metabolites that predicted any complication, 74 predicted one, 27 predicted two, and four predicted all three. In a pooled analysis of 69 metabolites without treatment arm interactions, histidine predicted lower odds of nephropathy (OR 0.75; 95% CI 0.69, 0.88), and serine predicted lower odds of nephropathy (OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.58, 0.82) and neuropathy (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.56, 0.84). Of 36 metabolites that interacted with treatment arm, higher N-carbamoyl-β-alanine predicted greater odds of nephropathy (OR 1.99; 95% CI 1.38, 2.99) and C22:0-sphingomyelin predicted lower odds of neuropathy (OR 0.54; 95% CI 0.37, 0.77) in the metformin arm. In the lifestyle intervention arm, quinolinic acid predicted greater odds of neuropathy (OR 1.64; 95% CI 1.24, 2.19). These estimates accounted for sex, race, baseline age, BMI and smoking, and time elapsed during follow-up. Further adjustment for HbA1c during follow-up, incident diabetes and eGFR did not change the results.
The existence of distinct metabolite profiles associated with single microvascular complications highlights the importance of characterising pathophysiological mechanisms specific to each complication, in addition to studying shared mechanisms across multiple complications.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-25">摘要</h3>
<p>The prevalence of obesity is rapidly increasing among adolescents in Kuwait. The ecological and dynamic changes within the oral microbiota during this developmental stage remain elusive. This study aimed to investigate the impact of body mass index (BMI) on salivary microbiome diversity and composition in Kuwaiti adolescents by utilizing next-generation sequencing technologies. DNA was extracted from saliva samples of 62 Kuwaiti adolescents enrolled in the nationwide Kuwait Healthy Lifestyle Study, categorized as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese based on their BMI percentiles. The 16 S metagenomic profiling was performed to identify the key oral lineages and genera associated with obesity through comprehensive analysis involving taxonomic composition, co-occurrence networks, and key metabolic profiles. Our study reveals an inverse relationship between oral bacterial diversity and obesity status in Kuwaiti adolescents. The obese and overweight groups showed comparatively low microbial taxa compared to those of normal weight. We identified three potential microbial biomarkers linked to obesity and overweight: Prevotella melaninogenica, Veillonella dispar, and Veillonella parvula. The abundance of Neisseria subflava and Rothia mucilaginosa in normal weight adolescents indicates their role in weight homeostasis. In- silico analysis of differentially expressed microbiota revealed increased activity of major metabolic enzymes such as glucose- 6- phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate oxidase, and glycogen phosphorylase, along with oxidative stress- related enzymes including superoxide reductase and glutathione peroxidase in obese and over-weight adolescents. Conversely, normal weight adolescents exhibited heightened activity of pyruvate synthase and tRNA- methyltransferase, which are linked to antioxidative pathways and balanced energy metabolism. Our study highlights taxonomic and functional shifts in the oral microbiota of Kuwaiti adolescents across varying BMI categories, signifying key microbial markers that could pave the way for future research focused on microbiome- targeted interventions in obesity management.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-26">摘要</h3>
<p>To review the MRI, histological, and clinical features of extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (EMC).
Retrospective review of pre-treatment MRIs in 44 patients with pathologically proven EMC. Patient demographics, tumor MR-imaging features, histology and gene rearrangements, clinical management, and follow-up were reviewed. MRI features assessed included lesion size, location, morphology, signal characteristics, and relation to adjacent structures. Correlative analysis was performed to assess associations between demographic, clinical, molecular, and MRI variables with metastatic disease.
EMCs were predominantly located in the lower extremity (38/44, 86%) and deep-to-fascia (36/44, 82%). All lesions (44/44) demonstrated well-circumscribed margins. Mean maximal dimension was 8.8 cm (range 1.7-36 cm); 93% (41/44) of lesions were hyperintense on fat-suppressed T2-weighted/ STIR imaging. Post-contrast enhancement was “solid” (&gt; 80% enhancement) in 18%, “mixed” (20-80% enhancement) in 53%, and “sparse” (&lt; 20% enhancement) in 29%. Nodal metastases were detected on preoperative imaging in four patients (9%), and pulmonary metastases in three cases preoperatively, and five cases postoperatively (range 14-128 months). EWSR1::NR4A3 fusion rearrangements were documented in 25 tumors (57%), and non-EWSR1 NR4A3 fusions in six cases (14%). The only variable demonstrating a significant correlation with metastatic disease was “solid” pattern of lesional enhancement (p = 0.035).
EMC is most commonly a deep lesion of the extremities demonstrating hyperintense T2-weighted signal, internal septations, and variable patterns of enhancement on MRI. Nodal disease is relatively frequent, and prolonged surveillance is recommended as metastases may develop years after diagnosis. Although analysis is limited by small case numbers, a “solid” (&gt; 80%) pattern of enhancement was significantly associated with metastatic disease.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-27">摘要</h3>
<p>Financial toxicity can negatively affect treatment adherence, quality of life, and survival in patients with cancer. Although screening for financial toxicity is increasingly implemented across oncology practices and cancer centers, less is known about challenges in delivering timely interventions after a positive screen. We evaluated outcomes and barriers in a systematic financial toxicity screening and referral program at a large comprehensive cancer center.
From March 2023 to December 2024, patients in breast, gynecologic, GI, and thoracic oncology clinics at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center completed an electronic survey assessing health-related social risks and the 12-item Comprehensive Score for Financial Toxicity (COST). A positive screen was defined as COST &lt;16, unmet essential need, or new loan/borrowing for treatment. Patients screening positive and requesting assistance were referred to Patient Financial Services (PFS) for follow-up. Outcomes included proportions with documented outreach, receipt of any intervention, intervention types, and barriers.
A total of 83,978 patients were eligible; of whom 50,949 (61%) completed screening. Of 9,724 positive screens, 8,004 (82%) requested follow-up, and 6,987 referrals were placed. PFS attempted follow-up in 3,383 patients (of the 6,987 = 48%), with documented interventions in 1,510 of 3,383 (45%). Counseling on financial resources (983/3,383 = 29%) was most common, followed by insurance-related counseling (402/3,383 = 12%) and formal program referrals (823/3,383 = 24%). Among patients referred to assistance programs, this was most often to the institutional Financial Assistance Program (438/796 = 55%) or social work (318/796 = 40%). The most frequent barrier was the inability to contact patients (1,464/3,383 = 43%).
Routine financial toxicity screening was implemented at scale and connected many patients to meaningful financial support. However, 81% of those who screened positive did not receive an intervention, underscoring the need for expanded infrastructure and policy reforms to address financial toxicity in cancer care.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-28">摘要</h3>
<p>The diameter, resistance index (RI), and plaque formation in the common carotid artery (CCA) are indicators of arterial remodeling, vascular resistance, and atherosclerosis, respectively. This study used CCA parameters to investigate the longitudinal relationship between radiation exposure and vascular damage.
This retrospective cohort analysis included 806 atomic bomb survivors with estimated radiation doses from the Hiroshima atomic bomb survivor study database, who underwent carotid artery ultrasonography between April 2003 and December 2021. Participants were divided into three groups based on their radiation doses: &lt;0.3 Gy, 0.3-3 Gy, and &gt;3 Gy. The highest quartile of each index was defined as having a large CCA diameter, a high RI, increased plaque number, and a greater maximum plaque thickness.
The median time between radiation exposure and carotid artery ultrasonography was 68.3 years. In the &lt;0.3 and &gt;3 Gy groups, the proportions of large CCA diameter were 24.2% and 50.0%, and the proportions of high RI were 23.5% and 54.6%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the &gt;3 Gy group had significantly larger CCA diameter (odds ratio [OR]: 4.36, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.30-14.7) and higher RI (OR: 4.04, 95% CI: 1.14-14.3) than the &lt;0.3 Gy group. The plaque number or maximum plaque thickness did not differ significantly among the three-radiation dose groups.
Radiation exposure may affect vascular resistance and remodeling.
To assess the risk of cardiovascular disease in radiation-exposed individuals, it appears necessary to investigate the effects of vascular damage other than atherosclerosis.</p>

<p>Based on the HIV stigma framework model and the modified socioecological framework, the study aimed to investigate the profiles of HIV-related stigma and the predictors of profile transition among PLWH in the context of China’s Regulation about “caring and anti-discrimination for PLWH”. The study utilized data from 1,198 PLWH (61.35% males; Mage = 41.03, SD = 9.19) who participated in a longitudinal socio-epidemiological research in Guangxi, China. Three waves of survey data were included in the analysis: T1 (May 2019, before the issue of Regulation), T2 (May 2020, half a year after the issue of Regulation), and T3 (November 2020, a year after the issue of Regulation). Latent transition analysis, a longitudinal and personal-center approach revealed that: (1) there were three distinct latent profiles among the participants: high HIV-stigma group (with higher anticipated and internalized HIV stigma), median HIV-stigma group, and lower HIV-stigma group (with lower internalized HIV stigma); (2) for individual level factors, female PLWH, PLWH with higher psychological distress, and PLWH with lower psychological capital tended to remain in or transition to high or median HIV-stigma group; and (3) for social level factors, tangible and informational supports (vs. affectionate support) were helpful for PLWH in low HIV-stigma group and were counterproductive for PLWH in high or median HIV-stigma group, and vice versa. These findings highlight the heterogeneity and transition of HIV-related stigma and guide tailored interventions to address HIV-related stigma among PLWH.</p>

<p>Rare-earth elements (REEs), characterized by their diverse chemical properties and forms, are increasingly recognized as valuable assets for enhancing agricultural production and improving the quality of agricultural products. This review systematically summarizes the significant positive impacts of REEs within the agricultural sector. Their unique characteristics can substantially enhance crop stress resistance, promote growth and development through improved photosynthesis and nutrient uptake, and increase yields. Moreover, REEs play a crucial role in innovative technologies for the rapid detection of pesticide residues, providing reliable solutions for traceability and anticounterfeiting measures related to agricultural products, thereby directly contributing to food safety. While acknowledging potential environmental and health risks associated with the excessive accumulation of REEs, this review primarily focuses on elucidating their substantial application value and underlying mechanisms. Finally, we address current challenges and future research directions with the aim of offering insightful perspectives on the sustainable and high-value utilization of rare-earth elements in modern agriculture.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-31">摘要</h3>
<p>Malnutrition is common among patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and may diminish the survival benefits of immunotherapy. We aimed to evaluate the association between nutritional status-assessed using the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) at initiation of first-line therapy and overall survival in patients with advanced NSCLC receiving immunotherapy.
We conducted a retrospective cohort study using an administrative claims database. Patients aged ≥18 years who received first-line immunotherapy for newly diagnosed advanced NSCLC between December 2016 and December 2024 were included. GNRI was calculated using the laboratory and anthropometric data closest (within 3 months) to treatment initiation. To examine whether the GNRI modifies the association between immunotherapy as a first-line therapy and overall survival in patients with advanced NSCLC, we used nonlinear multivariable Cox proportional hazards regressions.
Among 2461 patients (mean (SD) age: 70.85 (8.97) years; 81% males), the mean (SD) GNRI was 93.20 (12.93). Using GNRI 100 as the reference, lower GNRI values conferred progressively higher risks of death.
Routine nutritional screening using GNRI and proactive interventions to maintain a GNRI ≥ 100, may improve overall survival in patients with advanced NSCLC receiving immunotherapy.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-32">摘要</h3>
<p>Bronchial asthma is a common chronic respiratory disease in children. For many years, concerns about exercise-induced bronchoconstriction have limited physical activity in this population, with negative consequences for both physical and mental health. Recent evidence indicates that exercise should be incorporated into the daily routine of children with asthma, with appropriately prescribed programs shown to improve disease control, lung function, and quality of life. This study aims to systematically describe the safety, benefits and key factors of exercise for children with asthma.
Initiated by the National Clinical Research Center for Child Health, this set of recommendations was developed by a multidisciplinary team of 17 experts. A comprehensive Literature search was conducted across PubMed, Embase, Cochrane and other databases, yielding 64 studies that met inclusion criteria up to May 2025. The Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine 2011 levels of evidence were used to evaluate evidence quality. Two rounds of expert voting were conducted using Delphi methodology to formulate final recommendations on key clinical topics.
Recommendations were formulated across nine core domains: exercise safety, exercise-related benefits, pre-exercise screening, exercise prescription design, plan adjustment and progression, pre-exercise preparation, exercise monitoring, outcome assessment and the management of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. Specific guidance is offered on individualized exercise planning based on asthma control status, physical fitness, exercise habits and environmental factors. Recommendations also address appropriate modalities of aerobic, resistance and flexibility training, strategies for monitoring intensity and progression and both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic approaches to exercise-induced bronchoconstriction prevention and management.
These recommendations provide scientific and practical guidance for the development and implementation of individualized exercise prescriptions in children with asthma. Moreover, they highlight the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration and reinforce exercise as an integral component of asthma management. Further high-quality clinical research is needed to optimize exercise protocols and evaluate long-term outcomes.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-33">摘要</h3>
<p>Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) has become a major global health issue. Mitochondrial damage plays a crucial role in the development and progression of MASH. Therefore, it is speculated that mitochondrial transplantation therapy, which could replace dysfunctional mitochondria with normal ones, might potentially restore the liver cell metabolism of MASH. In palmitate-damaged AML-12 hepatocytes, exogenous mitochondria could eliminate lipid deposits and recover cell viability. However, in transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)-activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), the exogenous mitochondria showed the capability to inhibit the generation of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and collagen I. Moreover, the mechanism by which the exogenous mitochondria initiated the mitochondria-nucleus signaling pathway of liver cells was studied. The results showed the mitochondria could prevent metabolism disorders in the liver cells by regulating silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) activity. Subsequently, a MASH animal model was established by the administration of a high-fat diet and the intraperitoneal injection of carbon tetrachloride to Kunming mice. The results indicated that the mitochondrial therapy significantly inhibited the livery injury and restored liver cell function in the experimental MASH mice (p &lt; 0.01). The mitochondrial therapy would be a promising strategy to improve MASH pathological features, which could be developed as a new treatment option against MASH.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-34">摘要</h3>
<p>In advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R substitution mutations (Ex19del/L858R), intravenous amivantamab is approved for first-line treatment with lazertinib, and second-line treatment with carboplatin-pemetrexed. Subcutaneous amivantamab demonstrated noninferior pharmacokinetics and comparable efficacy with improved safety outcomes versus intravenous amivantamab in the PALOMA-3 trial. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) was also reduced when combined with prophylactic anticoagulation. In the COCOON trial, an enhanced prophylactic dermatologic regimen with intravenous amivantamab plus lazertinib treatment lowered grade ≥ 2 dermatologic adverse events (AEs). There are no studies combining subcutaneous administration with supportive care advancements in diverse participants with EGFR-mutated NSCLC. COPERNICUS (NCT06667076), an open-label, phase 2b study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous amivantamab with lazertinib (cohort 1) or with chemotherapy (cohort 2) while preventing and proactively managing VTE and dermatologic AEs in a multinational, clinically representative population with EGFR-mutated NSCLC.
Eligible participants are adults with EGFR Ex19del/L858R NSCLC. A pragmatic study approach will be used to eliminate potential barriers to enrollment and increase diversity. Cohort 1 will enroll participants without prior systemic therapy to receive subcutaneous amivantamab and oral lazertinib. Cohort 2 will enroll participants with disease progression on EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors to receive subcutaneous amivantamab and chemotherapy (carboplatin-pemetrexed). Both cohorts will receive enhanced dermatologic management; cohort 1 will receive prophylactic anticoagulation for the first 4 months of treatment. The primary endpoint is investigator-assessed progression-free survival.
COPERNICUS is currently enrolling, with a planned enrollment in the United States of 300 and 30 participants in cohorts 1 and 2, respectively, plus 150 participants for cohort 1 in Europe.
COPERNICUS uses a pragmatic study design to evaluate the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous amivantamab regimens combined with advancements in supportive care to prevent and proactively manage AEs in a diverse participant population. Supplementary file1 (MP4 117333 KB).</p>

<h3 id="摘要-35">摘要</h3>
<p>The relationship between sarcopenia and chronic lung disease (CLD) has not been widely studied. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) data to investigate the relationship between sarcopenia status and its developed status and CLD in the middle-aged and older Chinese people.
We selected 4444 participants over the age of 45 from CHARLS in 2011. Sarcopenia status was defined according to the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019 (AWGS 2019) criteria. CLD was defined as the presence of physician-diagnosed chronic lung disease. We retrospectively assessed their sarcopenia during 2011 and 2013, which were classified into never and newly developed sarcopenia, and these participants were followed from 2013 to 2018.
During the 2011-2018 follow-up, 554 (12.4%) CLD events were identified. The new incidence rate of CLD in the sarcopenia group, newly developed sarcopenia group, low muscle mass alone group respectively 17.9% (54/302), 17.3% (39/226), and 13.8% (80/576). In the longitudinal analysis, individuals with sarcopenia [HR (95% CI): 1.468(1.068-2.017)] (P&lt;0.01), newly developed sarcopenia [HR (95% CI): 1.486(1.031-2.141)] (P&lt;0.05) and low muscle mass alone [HR (95% CI):1.555(1.174-2.059)] (P&lt;0.01) were more likely to have new onset CLD.
Sarcopenia, newly developed sarcopenia, and low muscle mass alone were associated with higher CLD risk among middle-aged and older Chinese adults. Therefore, early prevention and treatment of sarcopenia and avoiding its progression may help decrease the incidence of CLD.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-36">摘要</h3>
<p>Manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe) serve as essential cofactors for numerous enzymes and play critical roles in neural functions within the central nervous system. However, chronic overexposure to these metals can disrupt neurophysiological homeostasis. The mechanisms underlying combined Mn-Fe exposure induced neurotoxicity remain unclear. Sodium para-aminosalicylate (PAS-Na), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier, has demonstrated efficacy in treating Mn poisoning. This study investigated the neurotoxic effects of Mn-Fe co-exposure in rats and evaluated the protective role of PAS-Na. Our findings reveal that Mn-Fe co-exposure induced significant weight gain suppression, increased liver coefficient, and extensive motor dysfunction manifested as coordination deficits, balance disturbance, and reduced muscle endurance. Histopathological analysis demonstrated severe neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra, characterized by neuronal atrophy, Nissl body depletion, and dopaminergic neuron loss (evidenced by reduced TH⁺ cells and TH protein expression). Furthermore, co-exposure disrupted metal homeostasis, elevating nigral Fe and Ca levels, and activating the NF-κB pathway, upregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6). Notably, PAS-Na treatment (160-240 mg/kg) dose-dependently attenuated these effects through two mechanisms: (1) modulating metal accumulation (particularly Fe) and (2) suppressing NF-κB-mediated neuroinflammation, with preferential inhibition of TNF-α. These findings highlight PAS-Na’s potential as a preventive therapy for metal-induced neurodegeneration, particularly in occupational co-exposure scenarios. The study provides novel insights into synergistic Mn-Fe neurotoxicity and identifies NF-κB inhibition as a promising therapeutic target.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-37">摘要</h3>
<p>Edentulism significantly impacts Chinese middle-aged and elderly adults’ physical and mental health, yet research on this remains limited. This study aimed to profile edentulous patients and analyze edentulism’s disease burden.
Data from 11,142 participants aged ≥ 45 were analyzed. Basic characteristics between edentulous and dentate groups were compared, ArcGIS mapped edentulism’s geographical distribution, restricted cubic spline plots identified risk factor inflection points, and relative risk (RR) evaluated combined burdens.
Edentulous and dentate groups differed in demographic characteristics, overall health status, Life behaviors and psychosocial factors, economic status and access to medical resources, and laboratory examinationsfactors.The GIS map shows the high-incidence areas of edentulism. Risk of edentulism surged for those over 67, with BMI &lt; 21.12, income &lt; ¥21,170, or CESD-10 &gt; 12. Heatmaps showed edentulism, combined with other factors, burdened physical diseases, mental disorders, and cancer differently.
Edentulism in Chinese middle-aged and elderly population is multifactorial and associated with increased burden of physical diseases, mental disorders, and potentially elevated cancer risk. To mitigate these risks, targeted strategies are needed, including improving oral health education, expanding access to denture rehabilitation (especially in rural areas), and integrating oral health management into chronic disease prevention policies.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-38">摘要</h3>
<p>The term “dioxins” encompasses a group of chlorinated organic pollutants, including polychlorinated dibenzo-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), which impact human health, affecting immunological, neurological, endocrine, and reproductive systems. Activities like burning fuels, waste incineration, landfill fires, and certain industrial processes are major sources of dioxin emissions. There has been much debate on the quantity of dioxins released by waste incinerators but considerably less debate has been carried out on the dioxin emissions of landfill fires. Thus, this study evaluates dioxin emissions changes in countries that have transitioned from landfill to waste-to-energy (WTE) in a specific period. This study analyzes data from selected countries, including the UK, Austria, Poland, Ireland, Norway, Lithuania, Finland, and China, and applies parametric estimation methods to determine changes in dioxin emissions during the transition from landfill to WTE. The results of this study indicate that reducing landfilling leads to a significant decrease in dioxin emissions. In the studied countries, dioxin emissions decreased in the range of 27% and 94% per mass unit of waste treated by WTE and landfill methods. This reduction emphasizes the potential of WTE to increase environmental sustainability compared to traditional landfilling. Also, it confirms that the reduction of landfill fires is the main factor in the reduction of dioxin emissions. The study’s insights may serve as guidance for underdeveloped and developing regions seeking to mitigate dioxins and other pollution through modernized waste treatment infrastructure.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-39">摘要</h3>
<p>Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is a major cereal crop recognized for its abundant β-glucan content, a soluble dietary fiber exhibiting significant nutritional and immunomodulatory properties. Structurally composed of mixed-linkage (1→3)(1→4)-β-D-glucopyranosyl units, barley β-glucans possess unique physicochemical attributes underpinning their biological activity. Their biosynthesis is primarily governed by cellulose synthase-like (Csl) genes, notably HvCslF6, while environmental conditions, agronomic practices, and genetic diversity further modulate β-glucan accumulation. β-glucans act as natural immunomodulators, engaging pattern recognition receptors such as Dectin-1, Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), and CR3, thereby activating key innate and adaptive immune pathways, including the MyD88 and Syk cascades. This results in enhanced macrophage, dendritic cell, activate natural killer (NK) cells, and T-cell functions, along with modulation of inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. Barley β-glucans also exert antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and metabolic regulatory effects, contributing to the management of chronic conditions including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, and inflammatory disorders. Recent advancements in pretreatment (germination, fermentation, ultrasonic-assisted extraction), molecular breeding (QTL mapping, GWAS, MAS), and genome editing (CRISPR/Cas9 targeting Csl genes) have accelerated efforts to optimize β-glucan yield and functionality. Emerging applications extend beyond nutrition to biomedical materials and vaccine adjuvants, driven by β-glucan’s ability to induce trained immunity and enhance vaccine responses. Nonetheless, structural heterogeneity and incomplete mechanistic insights pose challenges to clinical translation. This review critically integrates molecular, immunological, and biotechnological perspectives on barley β-glucans, emphasizing the need for multidisciplinary strategies to unlock their full therapeutic and functional potential in advancing human health and sustainable food systems.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-40">摘要</h3>
<p>Vector-borne diseases account for over 17% of all infectious diseases worldwide, with malaria and mosquito-borne arboviruses emerging as a significant and escalating threat. In Ethiopia, malaria and arboviruses such as Dengue and Yellow fever viruses pose substantial public health challenges; however, surveillance efforts are hindered by traditional methods that are costly and labor-intensive, yet unable to identify cryptic species. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding presents a promising alternative, facilitating noninvasive and high-throughput detection of vector species directly from environmental samples.
This pilot study evaluated the utility of eDNA metabarcoding for mosquito identification in Ethiopia’s Great Rift Valley. A total of 29 water and soil samples were collected from diverse mosquito breeding habitats in August 2023. For eDNA extraction, samples were pooled into 13 groups to maximize yield and reduce sequencing costs, using the NucleoSpin® eDNA Water and Soil kits. The eDNA was amplified with universal primers targeting the mitochondrial COI gene, primarily for mosquito detection. Targeted amplicon sequencing was performed on an in-house Illumina platform. For phylogenetic analysis, sequences were aligned with MAFFT, and trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining method with a Tamura-Nei model in Geneious Prime. Species identification was carried out using the BOLD System and NCBI BLAST. Out of 13 pooled environmental samples analyzed, eight (61.5%) tested positive for mosquito DNA, identifying three species: Anopheles coustani, Culex poicilipes, and Mansonia uniformis. Notably, this marks the first documented detection of Cx. poicilipes in Ethiopia, a known vector for Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV). The positive samples were collected from various habitats, including a water storage container, a ditch, a discarded tire, a flooded river, and a swampy area, showcasing the method’s adaptability to diverse sample types.
eDNA metabarcoding is a scalable tool for mosquito surveillance in resource-limited settings. This approach can strengthen national surveillance programs by enabling the early detection of medically important species and expanding coverage to logistically challenging habitats. Future studies should integrate pathogen screening to assess direct transmission risks and expand seasonal sampling for longitudinal monitoring.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-41">摘要</h3>
<p>Pollution by aromatic hydrocarbon compounds is closely associated with oil industry activities and poses significant environmental and human health risks. Biodegradation using hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria, particularly in combination with dispersants, offers a promising approach to mitigate such pollution. In this study, phenanthrene was used as a model compound to evaluate the effect of dispersant addition on the degradation capacity of Bacillus subtilis strain CYA27. Two dispersants were compared: a palm oil-based dispersant (Bio-OSD) and a petroleum-based dispersant (Non-Bio-OSD). The results showed that the presence of Bio-OSD and Non-Bio-OSD enhanced phenanthrene degradation, achieving up to 73.9% and 46.7% after 35 days, respectively. This improvement was attributed to increased substrate bioavailability, the potential use of dispersants as an auxiliary carbon source via a cometabolic mechanism, as supported by the detection of catechol dioxygenase activities (C12O and C23O) and selected metabolic intermediates, which provide preliminary evidence for possible enzymatic involvement in aromatic ring cleavage. Metabolic profiling using LC-MS/MS revealed that the degradation pathways utilised in the presence of dispersants included both the salicylic acid and phthalic acid pathways, which are further metabolised through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. In contrast, phenanthrene biodegradation proceeded without a dispersant via the formation of 4-methoxy-1-naphthol, suggesting a methoxylation mechanism that potentially reduces toxicity but does not proceed to the TCA cycle. These findings revealed that dispersants not only enhance substrate bioavailability but also alter bacterial metabolic preferences, highlighting their dual role in oil spill bioremediation strategies. This work provides novel insight into phenanthrene catabolism and the mechanistic effects of dispersants on marine PAH biodegradation.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-42">摘要</h3>
<p>Sporotrichosis is a neglected subcutaneous mycosis, globally distributed, caused by thermal dimorphic Sporothrix species. Despite their pathogenic potential in vertebrates, the virulence mechanisms underlying the interaction of these fungi with other groups of organisms remain poorly understood. The present study utilized the coleopteran insect Tenebrio molitor as an experimental model to assess the virulence of seven Sporothrix species belonging to the clinical (Sporothrix brasiliensis, Sporothrix schenckii, Sporothrix globosa, and Sporothrix luriei) and environmental (Sporothrix pallida, Sporothrix mexicana, and Sporothrix chilensis) clades. Larvae were inoculated with conidia or yeast cells and evaluated for survival, fungal burden (colony forming units), histopathology, hemocyte count, and expression of antimicrobial peptide genes. The virulence patterns in this model mirrored those observed in mammalian models for Sporothrix species from the clinical clade, with S. schenckii and S. brasiliensis exhibiting higher virulence (larvae survival rate 30-40%). Furthermore, the study revealed distinct virulence profiles between the mycelial and yeast phases of the fungi, with the yeast phase generally associated with increased virulence. However, contradicting previous findings, in the murine model, the environmental clade species S. pallida and S. chilensis displayed unexpectedly high virulence in their mycelial phase in T. molitor (larvae survival rate of 30% and 10% respectively). Also, the expression profile of AMP genes (Thamatin-like 1 and Tenecin 3) was similarly higher for those larvae infected with S. brasiliensis and S. pallida. These results indicate that the immune response to Sporothrix species in this invertebrate model may also have been shaped by the natural history of coleopteran insects and the Sporothrix genus. Our study highlighted the complex interplay between fungal virulence, host immune response, and ecological factors in shaping the outcome of Sporothrix infections in T. molitor.
Virulence of Sporothrix species was studied in Tenebrio molitor based on survival and antimicrobial peptide gene expression. Clinical species showed higher virulence as yeast, as expected, while environmental species were highly virulent as conidia, possibly due to prior ecological interactions.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-43">摘要</h3>
<p>The rapid and precise detection and discrimination of structurally analogous analytes remain highly desirable yet challenging. In this work, a ratiometric room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) sensor array integrated with phosphorescence amplification and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven data processing was developed for the rapid discrimination and quantification of the mixture of oxolinic acid (OLA) and flumequine (FMQ). The sensor array leverages paper substrates to amplify the blue RTP signals of the OLA and FMQ and the green RTP signals of 1,5-naphthalenedisulfonic acid through a confinement and thermal annealing mechanism. By coupling these amplified signals with automated AI processing and pattern recognition, quantification, and discrimination, the mixture of OLA and FMQ was realized, as low as 1.96 μM, within 10 min. In addition, the entire process could be executed by using a smartphone-based camera, eliminating the need for specialized instrumentation. The sensor array also demonstrated exceptional performance in practical samples, including environmental and food matrices, and paved the way for innovative sensor design.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-44">摘要</h3>
<p>The importance of multidisciplinary discussion (MDD) in interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) is well known. The aim of this study was to describe the 10-year experience of the MDD at the Pisa University Hospital in diagnosis and management of ILDs.
A single-center retrospective observational study was conducted at the Pisa University Hospital. A multidisciplinary group for ILDs diagnosis was instituted in 2012, and all patients referred till August 2022 were included.
Altogether 1240 patients were evaluated. At baseline assessment, 772 common multidisciplinary diagnoses were achieved, while in 458 cases it was not possible to obtain a definite diagnosis. Most frequent multidisciplinary diagnoses were idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), and smoking-related ILDs. In 9% of cases a histological evaluation was performed, leading to a diagnosis in 75% of cases. One-thousand and fourty-eight cases with at least one year of follow-up after the MDD were revised. Common diagnoses were confirmed or modified, while “diagnostic hypotheses” were changed into “revised diagnoses” or left as hypothesis as they still could not be confirmed. Among common diagnoses, 61% were confirmed, while 36% were not confirmed as patients did not perform further examinations or visits. Eighteen diagnoses were modified (3%). Among the “diagnostic hypotheses,” 57% changed into “revised diagnoses.” Only in 15% of cases a definite diagnosis was not achieved after the revision.
The role of MDD in ILDs’ assessment and diagnosis was confirmed. A multidisciplinary approach should be considered in the long-term follow-up of ILDs, as diagnosis may change on the basis of clinical course.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-45">摘要</h3>
<p>Whether the traditional distinction between segmental and multifocal dystonia is clinically or scientifically useful remains unclear.
To evaluate whether idiopathic isolated adult-onset segmental and multifocal dystonia can be differentiated based on clinical features other than the contiguity of affected body regions.
We compared data on segmental and multifocal dystonia from two large dystonia databases established in the USA and Italy that used similar criteria for patient recruitment and assessment.
Compared to segmental dystonia, multifocal dystonia was characterized by a higher proportion of men, a younger age at dystonia onset, a greater frequency of upper limb dystonia, and a lower frequency of cranial dystonia at both onset and last examination. Segmental and multifocal dystonia had a similar frequency of alleviating maneuvers, non-motor eye symptoms in blepharospasm, and neck pain and tremor in cervical dystonia. Although the initial spread pattern from focal to segmental or multifocal appeared faster in the segmental dystonia group, adjusting the analysis for the initial body site involved revealed no significant differences between the two groups. Segmental and multifocal dystonia starting in the same body site showed similar age, sex, and spread characteristics. The observed differences and similarities were consistent across both independent databases.
Segmental and multifocal dystonia share differences and similarities. The observed differences may reflect a difference in the predominant site of dystonia onset. From a clinical perspective, therefore, the segmental/multifocal distinction is probably not valuable in the dystonia classification scheme, although further data may be needed from a pathophysiological perspective.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-46">摘要</h3>
<p>American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) adolescents and emerging adults’ health has been understudied, despite pressing inequities beginning at this critical developmental period when lifelong health behaviors and chronic disease often emerge. Recruitment challenges are often described as a reason for underrepresentation of this population in health research. This paper systematically reviews research on recruitment approaches targeting AI/AN adolescents and emerging adults. We conducted a systematic review of the literature in June 2025. Inclusion criteria were articles focusing on recruitment of AI/AN participants ages 10 to 29 years into health research studies with &gt;3 sentences on recruitment. Search generated 793 nonduplicate peer-reviewed articles. Sixteen met inclusion criteria. Identified recruitment strategies focused on relational work, decreasing recognition and participation barriers, and showing respect for culture and autonomy. Relational recruitment methods are popular and effective in recruiting AI/AN adolescents and emerging adults from a variety of settings and regions to health studies.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-48">摘要</h3>
<p>Constipation, a prevalent gastrointestinal disorder, affects 10%-15% of adults in the USA and approximately 8.2% of China’s general population. Slow transit constipation (STC), accounting for 15%-42% of constipation cases, is defined by impaired colonic motility. For patients refractory to conservative treatment who experience chronic, intractable symptoms and diminished quality of life, surgical intervention becomes the treatment of last resort. The primary surgical approach for STC has traditionally been total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (TC-IRA). However, over the past two decades, subtotal colectomy with cecorectal anastomosis (SC-CRA) has gained increasing attention among clinicians due to its potential to reduce postoperative diarrhea. Despite this advantage, SC-CRA is also associated with concerns regarding an increased risk of recurrent constipation. The debate surrounding which approach is superior persists. This study aims to resolve this controversy through a comparative analysis of TC-IRA and SC-CRA, evaluating their therapeutic efficacy and safety profiles in refractory STC.
The STOPS trial is a prospective, randomized, multicenter-controlled clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of TC-IRA versus SC-CRA in treating patients with STC. After screening for eligibility and obtaining informed consent, a total of 252 adult patients will be randomized into two groups in a 1:1 ratio after assuring that none of the exclusion criteria is present. The primary outcome is the Wexner Constipation Score. The secondary outcomes include operative time, conversion rates, blood loss, short- and long-term complications, bowel movements, abdominal pain, bloating, straining, enema use, laxative use, Wexner Incontinence Score, gastrointestinal quality of life index (GIQLI), 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), and satisfaction. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months postoperatively.
This trial will be the first and largest randomized clinical trial to assess whether TC-IRA or SC-CRA should be the standardized surgical treatment for STC in terms of WCS outcomes. We hope that its findings will not only demonstrate the value of the surgical procedure in the treatment of STC, but also provide more reliable clinical evidence for further standardization of STC surgical treatment.

<h3 id="摘要-50">摘要</h3>
<p>Auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) health workers are pivotal in providing preventive and promotive healthcare services, including vaccinations, disease screening, antenatal checkups, and health education at the primary healthcare level. Their tireless efforts in strengthening primary healthcare and combating recent pandemics are evident. This study aimed to assess the extent, associated factors, and reasons for burnout in a district of West Bengal.
This mixed methods research (explanatory-sequential approach: Quan-Qual) was conducted from May 2022 to January 2023, involving randomly selected 226 ANMs from 13 rural blocks (cross-sectional design). ANMs with maximum burnout were purposively selected for the qualitative follow-up. A self-administered, modified Copenhagen Burnout Inventory questionnaire captured three domains of burnout. Responses from an open-ended free-listing guide identified reasons for burnout. Adjusted multinomial logistic regression analysis determined factors associated with burnout. Findings were integrated and presented in a joint display.
Out of 214 complete responses, 44.9% reported burnout, over single (20.1%), double (18.7%), and triple (6.1%) domains, namely personal (32.2%), work-related (28.5%), and patient-related (14.9%) burnouts. Chronic morbidity, lack of physical activity, and recent negative incidents were associated with higher burnouts, whereas &lt;5 km home to work-site distance and more support from supervisor were protective factors. Qualitative exploration revealed logistics problems, workload, distance, lack of support, etc., as reasons for burnout. After data triangulation, burnouts were identified with individual, interpersonal, community, and institutional level socioecological attributes.
Almost 45% ANM suffered burnout. Addressing the interrelated factors at different socioecological levels could enhance productivity and job satisfaction, fostering a positive work environment.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-52">摘要</h3>
<p>This study analyzes the mediating role of perceived benefits and barriers in the relationship between social support and the utilization of Non-Communicable Disease (NCD) Integrated Health Service Posts (IHSP) among industrial workers in Indonesia. The goal is to provide strong empirical evidence to inform the development of more effective, ecosystem-based occupational health interventions by understanding the perceptual mechanisms through which social support influences the uptake of health services in this high-risk population.
The study found that social support significantly increased the perception of benefits (β = 0.869) while simultaneously lowering perceived barriers (β = -0.613). Perceived benefits strongly predicted the use of NCD services (β = 0.612), while the influence of perceived barriers on service use was statistically insignificant. These results confirm the presence of asymmetric mediation, where the influence of social support on service utilization is predominantly channelled through strengthening the perception of benefits rather than simply reducing barriers. This implies that social support functions by resolving barriers at an “upstream” level, making the enhanced perception of benefits the primary driver for service uptake.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-53">摘要</h3>
<p>Life expectancy (LE) serves as a critical health metric for assessing changes in risk factors, health outcomes, and the effectiveness of medical treatments. This research sought to determine the impact of cardiovascular disease, road traffic accidents, and all types of cancer on the increase in Iranian life expectancy for the years 2010, and 2020.
Initial data on cardiovascular disease (CVD), all cancers, and road traffic injuries (RTI) by age, sex, and calendar year were obtained from the Iranian Death Registration System. Population data corresponding to these variables were retrieved from the Statistical Center of Iran. Finally, we utilized the period life table to estimate the effects of three mentioned causes of death on life expectancy increases. The data analysis was conducted using R software version 4.2.1.
In this study, excluding CVD increased life expectancy by 5.74 years for men and 10.62 years for women in 2010. In that calendar year, excluding deaths from RTIs increased life expectancy by 0.59 years for men and 0.24 years for women. Similarly, excluding cancer increased life expectancy by 1.31 years for men and 1.24 years for women. In 2020, excluding CVD increased life expectancy by 4.99 years for men and 9.66 years for women. Excluding road traffic injuries increased life expectancy by 0.46 years for men and 0.17 years for women. Excluding cancer increased life expectancy by 1.48 years for men and 1.39 years for women.
Our study found that at the national level, eliminating cardiovascular disease and then cancer had the greatest gain in life expectancy at birth and at other ages. Compared with the other two outcomes, the elimination of road traffic deaths had the smallest increase in life expectancy.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-54">摘要</h3>
<p>Information on the effects of the use of electronic cigarettes and heated cigarettes on oral health status is sparse. In addition, few studies have reported the oral health behaviours of the users of such products. We examined the associations among smoking status (including the use of cigarettes and electronic/heated cigarettes), oral health behaviours, periodontal condition, and tooth loss in employed Japanese adults.
The participants were 512 employees of 20 business offices of 19 companies that are members of the Aichi Branch of the Japan Health Insurance Association. Between December 2019 and March 2020, we performed dental examinations and asked the participants to complete self-administered questionnaires. We obtained the results of specific health check-ups from the Japan Health Insurance Association. Periodontal status was evaluated using the Community Periodontal Index and the loss of attachment. Multivariable linear regression analysis and structural equation modelling were performed to examine the relationship between periodontal condition/tooth loss and other factors.
In multivariable linear regression analysis, smokers had 1.38 fewer teeth on average compared to nonsmokers. Compared to nonsmokers, those who smoked cigarettes, electronic/heated cigarettes, or both had 15.4%, 17.9%, and 12.1% greater proportions of teeth with probing depth (PD) ≥ 4 mm and had 16.6%, 19.2%, and 9.99% greater proportions of teeth with attachment loss (AL) ≥ 4 mm, respectively. In structural equation modelling, cigarette smokers and participants who had no interest in oral health had fewer teeth. Cigarette smokers, electronic/heated cigarette smokers, and those who did not make an effort to care for their teeth still had more teeth with ≥ 4 mm PD and teeth with ≥ 4 mm AL.
The use of all cigarette types was significantly associated with poor oral health status. Smokers tended to pay less attention to their oral health, leading to poorer oral hygiene habits and worsening periodontal status. Providing smoking cessation support in workplaces and dental offices is important for maintaining the oral health of occupational adults. Because cross-sectional studies cannot clarify causality or the direction of the association between smoking and oral health status, further longitudinal studies are needed.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-57">摘要</h3>
<p>Riparian corridors in arid climates sustain life in otherwise inhospitable environments, creating zones of ecological and cultural importance. However, rivers in arid climates are often managed to provide water for human populations at the expense of a river’s freshwater biodiversity. In this study, ecosystem response to river flow management is assessed using mature cottonwood tree-ring growth and carbon isotope composition as bio-indicator proxies for river ecosystem health. We examine the ecological impacts of flow management on the Lower Truckee River in Nevada, USA, which runs through an arid-climate basin that has been subject to decades of heavy flow diversion and management. Particular attention is given to the effects of major lawsuits in 1973 and 1982 that restored spring and summer flows to the river following progressive dewatering since 1905. Most mature trees (&gt;30 years old) downstream of diversions responded strongly to restored flows, with average annual tree-ring growth increases of 160%. Among tested streamflow metrics, average annual flow had the strongest positive influence on cottonwood growth, and aspects of the spring snowmelt recession were also influential. Precipitation was also linked with cottonwood growth, primarily during the period of management before 1973 when dry season flows were severely limited. Not all floodplain trees responded similarly to changes in flow metrics, suggesting that individual tree attributes and heterogeneity in floodplain soils are highly important to tree growth. Results offer promising evidence that flow restoration can lead to measurable improvement in riparian forest productivity, although site-specific considerations including channel form and location on the floodplain are important in determining response to changes in flow patterns.</p>
