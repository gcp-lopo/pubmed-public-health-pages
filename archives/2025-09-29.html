<h3 id="摘要">摘要</h3>
<p>To understand barriers and facilitators to the implementation of a novel paediatric critical care nurse preceptor programme in Malawi.
Qualitative content analysis.
Using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), 20 individual interviews via Zoom were conducted. A predetermined codebook was used to code transcripts using the five CFIR domains. Barriers and facilitators were identified per domain and coded using the CFIR constructs, and themes were generated per domain.
Participants reported the preceptor programme was comprehensive, well designed and delivered effectively (innovation). Partnerships are essential to the programme’s initiation and likely are important to the programme’s sustainability (outer setting). Participants voiced challenges with the lack of physical and human resources, leading to prioritisation of patient needs over programme attendance at times (inner setting). Yet, preceptors were motivated by this programme and appreciated the advantage of this programme over previous programmes and gained confidence and competence in their ability to precept students (individuals). In terms of the process, participants felt they needed additional time to devote to this programme and fully engage (process).
This paediatric critical care nurse preceptor programme had significant strengths across all five CFIR domains, yet participants also discussed areas to improve upon. Participants voiced enthusiasm for the programme to be sustained and to expand within and beyond Malawi.
Understanding the barriers and facilitators to a programme is critical before scaling up or scaling out. Improving challenges and building upon facilitators will strengthen the programme in future iterations.
Providing bedside nurses with knowledge and skills to precept students may decrease the shortage of quality paediatric critical care nurses through two avenues: (1) empowering them with confidence and competence and (2) improving the pipeline of well-trained students. Ultimately, improving clinician quality can impact patient outcomes.
This study complied with the standards for reporting qualitative research (SRQR).
No patient or public contribution.</p>

<h2 id="article-2">2. The Relationship Between Attachment Styles and Love Attitudes of Undergraduate Nursing Students.</h2>

<h3 id="摘要-1">摘要</h3>
<p>Exploring the attachment styles and love attitudes of young nursing candidates sheds light on their personal and interpersonal experiences. This study aimed to examine undergraduate nursing students’ attachment styles and love attitudes and the relationship between them.
This study was conducted at a state university in northern X, with 335 undergraduate nursing students completing the Relationship Questionnaire Survey (RQS) and the Love Attitudes Scale (LAS). The study used a cross-sectional design and the convenience sampling method.
The results of the correlation analysis of the scores obtained from the participants’ responses indicated a negative relationship between secure attachment and mania love. Conversely, positive correlations were identified between secure attachment and storge love, obsessive attachment and mania love, fearful attachment and mania love and indifferent attachment and pragma love.
It is very important for university students, especially nursing students, to protect and strengthen their own emotional well-being and that of those they care for. It is necessary to develop special educational content and establish psychosocial support units tailored to young nursing candidates that promote secure attachment and functional close relationships. Additionally, grounding educational content and psychosocial support units in self-compassion, self-esteem and physical and spiritual empowerment is crucial. The effectiveness of these initiatives must be rigorously evaluated to ascertain their impact.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-2">摘要</h3>
<p>To define the role, competencies and clinical focus of specialised breast cancer nurses and to explore post-basic academic training programmes available in Western countries.
A scoping review was reported following the PRISMA-ScR framework and aligned with JBI methodology.
The research question was formulated using the Population, Concept and Context model. Searches were performed across four databases (Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL and Gray Literature) between July and September 2024. Article screening and data extraction were independently performed by two authors. Descriptive analysis was employed to interpret the data.
From an initial 1499 records, 143 studies were selected, with 16 included in the final analysis. The studies, published between 2001 and 2024, evaluated the role of breast cancer nurses in oncology, focusing on their impact on patient care, health outcomes, quality of life, psychological support and breast cancer nurses-led interventions. Two studies assessed educational programmes, identifying a diverse range of postgraduate degrees and specialised training options tailored to meet the specific needs of this essential nursing role.
Breast cancer nurses are crucial in delivering comprehensive care and improving QoL for breast cancer patients. They contribute to enhancing clinical outcomes through patient education and support. Ongoing professional development and expanded education are essential to meet evolving patient needs.
Breast cancer nurses play a pivotal role in improving patient outcomes by delivering education, psychological support and holistic care. To keep pace with the increasing complexity of breast cancer management, it is essential to prioritise expanded academic training and continuous professional development. These efforts will ensure BCNs are well prepared to address evolving patient needs and provide high-quality, comprehensive care.

<h3 id="摘要-3">摘要</h3>
<p>The integration of mobile cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) into brachytherapy workflows offers clinical advantages such as immediate verification of applicator placement and adaptive treatment planning. These benefits require sufficient image quality to delineate applicators, target volumes, and organs at risk. A systematic evaluation of automatic exposure control (AEC) settings, radiation dose, and image quality is essential to ensure clinically acceptable imaging while minimizing patient exposure.
This study evaluates the characteristics of AEC and its impact on image quality and radiation dose in a mobile CBCT system used for brachytherapy.
The Elekta ImagingRing CBCT system was used to scan a CatPhan phantom under two imaging protocols: Medium Dose Limit (MDL) and Ultra-High Dose Limit (UHDL). This system employs a two-layer mAs modulation process, consisting of preset mA values based on body mass index (BMI) and adjusted mA based on real-time AEC. A bolus was used to simulate larger patient sizes. Real-time x-ray tube current at 10 degrees intervals was recorded. Image quality was evaluated using image noise, noise power spectrum (NPS), modulation transfer function (MTF), Hounsfield Unit (HU) linearity, uniformity index (UI), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) across different protocols.
AEC effectively modulated x-ray tube current in the MDL protocol after x-ray attenuation through the scanned phantom was measured. The UHDL protocol demonstrated greater noise reduction than the MDL. MTF values were comparable between protocols, indicating preserved spatial resolution in the MDL protocol. HU linearity was consistent across all protocols, with R2 &gt; 0.993.
AEC in mobile CBCT optimized radiation dose and image quality by adjusting tube current based on attenuation. The MDL protocol reduced radiation exposure while maintaining image quality, making it a viable option for verifying applicator placement and treatment planning in brachytherapy. The UHDL protocol achieved noise reduction with the maximum available tube current.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-4">摘要</h3>
<p>Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a disease with a low survival rate and poor prognosis. Targeted therapies have improved treatment outcomes as driver mutations have been identified, especially in adenocarcinomas. Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) provides insights into the genetic mutation profile of cancer and helps identify actionable mutations. The mutational landscape of cancer varies based on the patient’s ethnic background, and there is limited information on the genetic profile of NSCLC within the Finnish population.
We analysed the genetic mutational profile of 96 advanced NSCLCs that underwent CGP between November 2021 and March 2023 at Tampere University Hospital. Additionally, we compared the genomic alterations in our cohort with those in the international datasets.
Clinically actionable alterations associated with a targeted therapy were identified in 45% of patients, including 63% of never-smokers and 41% of ever-smokers. The most common actionable alteration was KRAS G12C (18%), followed by EGFR alterations (14%). However, only 33% of the patients with an actionable alteration received targeted therapy. The median tumour mutational burden (TMB) was 5, with 31% of patients exhibiting a TMB greater than 10.
CGP affects the treatment strategies for NSCLC. Nearly half of our entire cohort had a genetic alteration eligible for approved targeted therapies. Besides these findings, CGP provides additional data to assess treatment decisions and outcomes, including co-occurring genetic alterations and TMB. In real-world clinical practice, the practical application of this information can be restricted by the varying unavailability of optimal treatments.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-5">摘要</h3>
<p>Preoperative differentiation of benign and malignant endometrial lesions, along with the identification of aggressive histological types of endometrial cancer (EC), is crucial for guiding treatment strategies. Time-dependent diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (TDD-MRI), which allows the characterization of tissue microstructure at the cellular level, is not currently applied for endometrial lesions. This study aimed to evaluate TDD-MRI-derived microstructural parameters for noninvasively distinguishing benign and malignant endometrial lesions and predicting aggressive histological types of EC.
This prospective study enrolled 177 patients with clinically suspected EC who underwent TDD-MRI between January 2024 and March 2025. The Imaging Microstructural Parameters Using Limited Spectrally Edited Diffusion method was used to extract microstructural parameters, including the cell diameter (d), intracellular volume fraction (vin), cellularity (number of cells per unit area), cellularity index (vin/d), and extracellular diffusivity (Dex), along with three apparent diffusion coefficient measurements. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to assess diagnostic performance. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the microstructural parameters and histopathological measurements was calculated.
A total of 130 women (mean ± standard deviation age: 56 ± 14 years) administered uterine curettage or surgery were included in the final analysis. All microstructural parameters showed significant differences between benign endometrial lesions and EC (P &lt; 0.05), as well as between nonaggressive and aggressive EC (P &lt; 0.05). Cellularity exhibited the highest AUC of 0.86 for distinguishing benign endometrial lesions from EC, whereas the cellularity index showed the highest AUC of 0.88 for distinguishing aggressive histological types. D0Hz was positively correlated with Dex (P &lt; 0.05) and negatively correlated with diameter (P &lt; 0.05), cellularity index (P &lt; 0.01) and vin (P &lt; 0.001) in patients with benign endometrial lesions. D0Hz was positively correlated with Dex (P &lt; 0.001) and negatively correlated with vin (P &lt; 0.001) in patients with EC. Microstructural parameters strongly correlated with corresponding pathological features (r = 0.77-0.83; P &lt; 0.001).
TDD-MRI-derived microstructural parameters demonstrated high performance in differentiating benign from malignant endometrial diseases and identifying aggressive types of EC.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-6">摘要</h3>
<p>To examine the T helper 17 (Th17)/regulatory T (Treg) immune balance in passive Heymann nephritis (PHN) rats with dampness syndrome (DS).
Rats were divided into four groups: normal control (NC), PHN model, PHN + DS model, and DS model. The DS model was created by administering lard, a 60% cold sucrose solution, and Chinese Baijiu viagavage. In contrast, PHN was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by injecting anti-Fx1A serum into the tail vein. The general condition of the rats was assessed, while the levels of urine protein, albumin, and serum creatinine were measured using commercially available kits. Pathological renal damage was evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid-schiff, and periodic acid-silver methenamine staining, while podocyte damage was assessed through immunohistochemistry. The proportions of Th17 cells and Treg cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were quantified by flow cytometry. Plasma cytokine levels of interleukin 17, transforming growth factor-β1, and interleukin 6 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
This study demonstrated a significant increase in proteinuria and total cholesterol levels in PHN rats with DS, along with more severe histopathological kidney damage. DS exacerbated podocyte damage in PHN rats. Additionally, the number of Treg cells was significantly reduced, while the ratio of Th17/Treg cells was significantly elevated in PHN rats with DS.
In conclusion, the findings of our study indicate that the presence of DS exacerbates renal injury in PHN, a rat model used to simulate experimental membranous nephropathy. This observation may be closely linked to the exacerbation of the Th17/Treg imbalance and podocyte injury in PHN rats induced by DS.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-7">摘要</h3>
<p>To explore the effect of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) constitution on cognitive impairment (CI) in patients with cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) and its underlying neuroimaging mechanism and to provide countermeasures for health management of CSVD patients.
A total of 241 CSVD patients were recruited from the Department of Neurology. All subjects underwent head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Chinese Medicine Questionnaire (CCMQ) and cognitive function examination. The CSVD patients were divided according to the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score into a normal cognitive group (73 cases) and a CI group (168 cases). Logistic regression was used to analyse the risk constitution of CSVD-CI and to construct a risk prediction model. 3DT1 MRI images and FreeSurfer 6.0 software (Athinoula A. Martinos, Boston, MA, USA) were used to further explore the involvement of hippocampal subregion volume in patients with at-risk constitution and its correlation with cognitive function.
Logistic regression analysis showed that Yang-deficiency constitution (YADC) (P = 0.020), older age (P = 0.008) and hypertension (P = 0.011) were risk factors for CSVD-CI but that balanced constitution (P = 0.003) and education (P &lt; 0.001) were protective factors. A receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was drawn, and the area under the curve was 0.820. Further comparison of overall hippocampal and 12 hippocampal subregion volumes between YADC and non-YADC patients revealed decreased total volume of the left and right hippocampus, bilateral subiculum, presubiculum, molecular layer and right fimbria in the YADC group (P &lt; 0.05/13, 13 is the number of hypothesis tests). Moreover, in the YADC group, the cognitive function of CSVD patients correlated positively with the overall volume of the left hippocampus (r = 0.304, P &lt; 0.05) and the molecular layer volume of the left hippocampus (r = 0.288, P &lt; 0.05).
CSVD patients with YADC are more prone towards developing CI, and asymmetric atrophy of the hippocampus might be the underlying neuroimaging mechanism. In particular, the volume of the left whole hippocampus and the left hippocampal molecular layer correlated significantly with general cognitive function.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-8">摘要</h3>
<p>Bevezetés: Az orthorexia nervosa viszonylag új kórkép, megítélése pedig máig viták kereszttüzében áll. Újabban a kutatók ezért megkülönböztetik az egészséges és a problémás orthorexiát, hiszen a tünetek mellett a hajlamosító tényezők is eltérnek. Célkitűzés: Kutatásunk célja, hogy hozzájáruljon a problémás és az egészséges orthorexia elkülönítéséhez, ezért azt vizsgáltuk, hogy milyen összefüggések igazolhatók az orthorexia alskálái (kognitív, érzelmi, problémás), valamint a vizsgált egyéb változók, így az egészséggel kapcsolatos információkeresés (internetes egészségműveltség, étrendi információs túlterhelés), a testhez való viszonyulás (testbecsülés), az ételválasztási preferenciák és az egészségszorongás között. Módszer: Az adatgyűjtés olyan online közösségimédia-felületeken történt, amelyek az egészséges életmóddal kapcsolatosak. A női minta 472 főből állt (18–75 évesek, átlag = 39,39 év, szórás = 11,95 év). Az Étkezési szokások kérdőív mellett a következő skálákat alkalmaztuk: Rövid Egészségszorongás Kérdőív, Testbecsülés Skála, Internetes Egészségműveltség Skála, Étrendi Információs Túlterhelés Skála, Ételválasztás Kérdőív. Eredmények: Korrelációs és többváltozós regresszióelemzés alapján jelentős különbségek mutatkoztak a prediktorstruktúrában az orthorexia három fajtája között. A kognitív orthorexia esetében amellett, hogy megjelenik az ételválasztási preferenciák közül az egészség és a természetesség, kiemelt szerepet kapnak az információs változók, azaz az egészségről szóló tudás megszerzése. Az érzelmi orthorexia esetében az egészségtudatos táplálkozás a testi és lelki jóllét céljaként szolgál, a testbecsülés pozitív előjelű, és az egészség mellett a súlykontroll is hangsúlyos. A problémás orthorexia esetében viszont az egészség mint ételválasztási preferencia mellett az egészségszorongás és a súlykontroll kap domináns szerepet. Következtetés: A jelen tanulmány felhívja a figyelmet a problémás, azaz kényszeres orthorexiára, amelynek táptalaja gyakran az egészségszorongás, a testsúllyal és a testképpel való (nem mindig reális) elégedetlenség. A prevenciós programokban az étrendi tájékoztatás mellett érdemes kitérni az orthorexia veszélyeire is. Orv Hetil. 2025; 166(39): 1549–1557.</p>

<p>Bevezetés: Az idős, illetve nagyon idős lakosságnál előforduló csípőtáji törések megjelenése gyakori. A sérülések jelentős csoportját a medialis combnyaktörések adják, amelyek traumatológiai kezelése alapvetően operatív módon végzendő. A terápia során az idős sérülteknél a mobilitás lehető leggyorsabb visszaállítása érdekében elsősorban az ízületpótló módszerek választandók. Anyag és módszerek: Jelen vizsgálatunk során 229, medialis combnyaktörés miatt bipoláris hemiarthroplasticán átesett páciens perioperatív adatait értékeltük retrospektív módon. Utánkövetésünk során kifejezett figyelmet fordítottunk a páciensek hemoglobinértékeire, illetve a műtét körüli komplikációk vizsgálatára. Eredmények: A műtéti beavatkozásokat a páciensek 76,5%-ánál tudtuk 24 órán belül elvégezni, míg az ellátás csupán 7 páciensnél húzódott 48 órán túlra. Általános perioperatív szövődménnyel 73 páciensnél (31,9%) találkoztunk. A komplikációk előfordulása függetlennek bizonyult a nemtől, az életkortól, az implantátum rögzítési módjától, a beavatkozás elvégzésének időpontjától vagy a műtét hosszától. A szövődmények mértéke és az antikoaguláns terápia között azonban nem szignifikáns tendencia mutatkozott. Ezenkívül a komplikációk szignifikáns kapcsolatát tapasztaltuk a dementiával és azzal, hogy milyen hamar került sor a műtéti ellátásra. Míg a páciensek 55,9%-a részesült orális antikoaguláns terápiában, addig 24,9%-uknál volt szükség vérpótlásra. A transzfúzió igénye egyértelmű összefüggést mutatott az antikoaguláns készítmények alkalmazásával (p = 0,022), valamint emelkedett volt a cementezéssel rögzített implantátum használatakor (p = 0,005), illetve szignifikánsan összefüggött a műtéti idő hosszával (p = 0,001). Megbeszélés: Az idős és nagyon idős, ezáltal már általában több alapbetegséggel is rendelkező, medialis combnyaktörést szenvedett páciensek kezelése során különösen fontos a lehető leghamarabb elvégzett és lehető legkíméletesebb műtéti ellátás a mobilizáció mielőbbi megkezdése és a komplikációk csökkentése érdekében. Erre sebészi szempontból a bipoláris hemiarthroplastica gyorsan és jó eredményekkel alkalmazható eljárás. Következtetés: Mindazonáltal a korai műtéti terápiát gyakran hátráltathatják a páciensek által szedett antikoaguláns készítmények. Emiatt, valamint a perioperatív szövődmények esélyének minimalizálásához a korai ellátáson túl fontos a páciensek megfelelő hemoglobin-menedzsmentje és a társbetegségek párhuzamos kezelése, amelyben nagy segítség lehet egy, a kezelésben a kezdetektől aktívan közreműködő geriáter szakorvos.

<p>Chemical contaminants are widely dispersed in the environment in all its dimensions, posing significant public health problems. Comprehensive knowledge of these stressors is a prerequisite for assessing the associated risk and implementing public policy measures to reduce the level of population exposure. Nontargeted suspect screening approaches broaden the knowledge of the chemical human exposome. We developed and used a suspect screening method based on large spectral libraries. Chemical profiling was based on a combined LC- and GC-HRMS approach. The methodology was applied to 16 samples spanning the environment, food, and health continuum. Using a combination of matching and scoring data, a total of 547 compounds were likely identified, from which the chemical structure of 63 molecules was confirmed to the highest level of certainty. Wastewater, and more generally environmental samples, had the highest number of chemicals detected, while fish samples had a lower number. Pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and personal care product-related compounds were found to be the most common compounds in and between the extracts, particularly in water and serum samples. Many natural and endogenous compounds were consistently annotated in the samples submitted for analysis, regardless of the compartment investigated.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-13">摘要</h3>
<p>Over 30,000 North Koreans have fled to South Korea, facing challenges in adapting to a new society. This study aimed to examine how cultural orientation, PTSD, and resilience influence their social adaptation.
A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 171 North Korean defectors using validated tools to assess cultural orientation, PTSD symptoms, resilience, and social adaptation.
PTSD was prevalent in 24% of participants and strongly negatively correlated with social adaptation (r = -.61, p &lt; .001). Resilience showed a positive association with adaptation (r = .46, p &lt; .001) and served as a protective factor against PTSD. Horizontal cultural orientation correlated with adaptation but was not a significant predictor. PTSD severity was the strongest predictor of poor adaptation.
These findings underscore the need for long-term, culturally appropriate mental health interventions and resilience-building programs to enhance the social integration of North Korean defectors and inform refugee support policy.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-14">摘要</h3>
<p>Self-employed individuals often go through periods of uncertainty and experience concerns regarding their business. Chronic health conditions (CHC) often intensify the sense of uncertainty and concerns for the future of their business. This study aims to examine the associations between health conditions, intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and job satisfaction among self-employed individuals with CHC. This study involved 294 self-employed participants with CHC (cancer, cardiac diseases, respiratory diseases, or inflammatory bowel diseases). Participants reported moderate levels of physical symptoms and job satisfaction. Physical symptoms were associated with lower job satisfaction. Mediation analysis showed that IU fully mediated the relationship between physical symptoms and job satisfaction, such that greater physical symptoms were associated with higher IU, which in turn predicted lower job satisfaction. Moderation analysis further revealed that this indirect relationship was significant only among older adults. The findings suggest that future research and policy efforts should consider IU and age as key psychological and demographic factors affecting job satisfaction. It is particularly important to implement tailored support programs, flexible work policies, and age-sensitive interventions so that these vulnerable populations can improve their occupational outcomes and quality of life.</p>

<p>Lack of access to healthful foods and food insecure environments are among the most significant issues in the United States, exacerbating health disparities especially among racially minoritized populations. Structural racism and other social determinants of health contribute to racial inequities in food and nutrition security. Many people of color in the United States do not have access to culturally relevant health care services, due to the impact of structural racism on health care access and representation in health professions. Addressing inequities in food access and nutrition security calls for systematic approaches that involve not only providing people with wholesome foods but also enabling them to embrace healthier diets. In this Career Development commentary, we share our experience as undergraduate students participating in the Delta GREENS (Growing a Resilient, Enriching, Equitable, Nourishing food System) project and our state-level policy recommendations for expanding the reach of Delta GREENS throughout Mississippi. Our collective efforts aim to instigate lasting transformations that enhance health outcomes and reduce health inequities in Mississippi. As the next generation of public health, health care, and policymaking professionals, we look forward to using our experiences and our voices to improve public health for all.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-16">摘要</h3>
<p>With the rise of data-intensive research, data literacy has become a critical capability for improving scientific data quality and achieving artificial intelligence (AI) readiness. In the biomedical domain, data are characterized by high complexity and privacy sensitivity, calling for robust and systematic data management skills. This paper reviews current trends in scientific data governance and the evolving policy landscape, highlighting persistent challenges such as inconsistent standards, semantic misalignment, and limited awareness of compliance. These issues are largely rooted in the lack of structured training and practical support for researchers. In response, this study builds on existing data literacy frameworks and integrates the specific demands of biomedical research to propose a comprehensive, lifecycle-oriented data literacy competency model with an emphasis on ethics and regulatory awareness. Furthermore, it outlines a tiered training strategy tailored to different research stages-undergraduate, graduate, and professional, offering theoretical foundations and practical pathways for universities and research institutions to advance data literacy education.
随着数据密集型研究的兴起，数据素养已成为提升科学数据质量、推动AI就绪（AI-ready）科学数据建设的关键能力。在生物医学领域，数据不仅规模庞大，而且呈现出高度复杂性与多样性，同时伴随显著的隐私性和敏感性特征，对研究者提出了更高要求。本文重点回顾了生物医学领域科学数据治理的技术发展趋势及政策环境演进，指出标准不一致、语义错配和合规意识不足等长期存在的挑战，而这些问题在根本上多源于缺乏系统化培训和实践支持。针对这一现实，本研究在既有数据素养框架的基础上，结合生物医学研究的独特需求，构建了一个全面的、覆盖数据全生命周期的数据素养能力模型，并强调伦理与监管意识的重要地位。同时，本文提出分层化培训策略，面向本科生、研究生和专业科研人员，提供兼具理论基础与实践路径的教育方案，以期推动高校与科研机构在生物医学领域系统提升数据素养水平。.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-17">摘要</h3>
<p>The care of patients hospitalized for acute heart failure (AHF) has been largely unchanged from the early 1960s until a few years ago, consisting mainly of oxygen and diuretics supplemented sometimes by other vasoactive drugs. These treatments, although effective in the short term in controlling congestion, do not prevent early readmissions and death, occurring in over 30% of patients in the 6 months after an AHF hospitalization. In the last years, studies showed that AHF diagnosis can be improved, early diuretic care can be optimized, and early intensive therapy with combined drug regimens can reduce the rate of adverse outcomes. However, unlike acute coronary syndromes, where guidelines have existed since 1996, there are no separate detailed guidelines for AHF. In a series of four papers (International Expert Opinion Series on AHF Management) an international expert group highlights important aspects of AHF care where the evidence base to inform clinical practice is lacking. These papers focus on (1) diagnosis and treatment during prehospital and in the emergency department, (2) management during the first days of admission, (3) care before and after AHF discharge, and (4) hospitalized AHF management in patients presenting with cardiogenic shock, significant valvular disease, or end-stage renal disease. These papers are not intended to serve as guidelines, but rather to suggest a framework for future recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of AHF. In the current summary paper, we highlight the main considerations and key recommendations in each of the parts of AHF care.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-18">摘要</h3>
<p>Ammonia has a wide range of applications in various branches of industry and technology; the detection of its low concentrations is a preventive method for ambient air quality pollution and a useful method for noninvasive diagnosis of kidney disease by monitoring in exhaled human breath. In this work, a high-performance ammonia sensor based on the Fe2O3/MWCNTs (multiwalled carbon nanotubes) material was produced by applying the e-beam deposition method. The morphology, composition, and chemical state of the Fe2O3/MWCNTs material were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Raman spectroscopy (Raman), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The gas-sensing behavior of the sensor to various concentrations of NH3 was measured at 200 °C, representing excellent gas response and sophisticated performance parameters. The low detection limit of the Fe2O3/MWCNTs sensor was 3 ppm of NH3, corresponding to the response value of 2.7. The promising values of the response and recovery times (40 and 25 s) confirmed the high speed of ammonia detection. Thus, the suggested Fe2O3/MWCNTs material that is sensitive to low concentrations of NH3 can be successfully used in a new generation of ammonia alarm systems.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-19">摘要</h3>
<p>Previous studies have found significant sex differences in symptoms among patients with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS). However, whether this translates into differences in pathology as observed on cystoscopy is unknown. We sought to assess cystoscopic findings in veterans diagnosed with IC/BPS and to identify possible sex differences in cystoscopic findings.
This was a retrospective study of all hospital visits in the Veteran Health Affairs Hospital System between October 2004 and July 2016. Patients with IC/BPS were identified from the Veteran Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI) system using appropriate ICD codes. Patients older than 18 years of age with a confirmed diagnosis of IC/BPS who underwent cystoscopy were included. Rates of cystoscopic findings of ulceration, glomerulation, inflammation, trabeculation, and tumors adjusted for patient demographics were analyzed.
A total of 570 patients met inclusion criteria and underwent analysis (57.9% female). The female cohort was of younger age (48.0 vs. 63.0 years). After adjusting for age, men and women had a similar likelihood of presenting with Hunner’s lesions (8.2% for men and 3.7% for women, p &gt; 0.05). They also had a similar likelihood of glomerulation (11.4% in men vs. 15.2% in women, p = 0.05) and inflammation (19.6% vs. 15.8%, p &gt; 0.05). Men were significantly more likely to present with trabeculation (15.4% vs. 8.1%, p = 0.03). Urothelial tumors on cystoscopy were rare in both groups.
The proportion of patients with ulceration on cystoscopy in this study is consistent with previously published studies, and our study showed a similar prevalence of Hunner’s lesions between men and women. Cystoscopic identification of Hunner’s lesions is an important aspect of IC/BPS management given that treatment directed that these lesions is relatively successful compared to other treatments.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-20">摘要</h3>
<p>Biological attributes play a role in promoting the biological and structural functionality of the soil, varying with land use and seasonality and being essential for sustainable soil management under family farming, especially in semi-arid areas. This study aimed to evaluate the composition of the edaphic fauna, microbial biomass carbon, glomalin production, and their inter-relationships with physical, structural, and chemical attributes in different land uses in the semi-arid region of Brazil using multivariate statistics to differentiate between environments. Sampling (0-20-cm depth) during dry/rainy seasons assessed granulometry, aggregation, phosphorus, organic carbon, microbial biomass, glomalin, and macroarthropod diversity. Multivariate analysis revealed four key factors: F1 (ecological indices and Hymenoptera/Diptera/Orthoptera diversity), F2 (silt, aggregation, carbon/phosphorus/glomalin), F3 (textural components), and F4 (potassium). Principal components distinguished cultivated areas (banana/papaya/Barbados cherry) through microbial biomass, organic carbon, phosphorus, aggregation, and Coleoptera/Diptera abundance. Native vegetation showed resilience with glomalin, Orthoptera, and Araneae dominance, while fallow/pasture exhibited biological/structural constraints (high clay, sodium, compaction). Rainy seasons enhanced macroarthropod diversity, particularly in native and fruit-cultivated areas. Surface residue retention and organic fertilization positively influenced carbon dynamics, phosphorus availability, and soil structure. Conservation practices promoted glomalin production and predator arthropod populations (Mantodea, Scutigeromorpha), indicating ecosystem resilience. These findings demonstrate that sustainable land management in semi-arid regions requires maintaining organic inputs and moisture to enhance biological activity and soil functionality, with native vegetation serving as a biodiversity reservoir. The study provides a framework for evaluating soil health in water-limited agroecosystems.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-21">摘要</h3>
<p>Soil trace metal(loid) background values (BVs) are important in risk assessment, but regional BVs are difficult to obtain. Here, BVs in the Daqiao river basin were established using a cumulative frequency distribution approach with deep (&gt; 100 cm) soil samples. A multidimensional risk assessment method evaluated the metal(loid) pollution and risks across three irrigated areas (first, FI; second, SI; and third, TI) and one unirrigated control area (UI). In addition, correlation analysis and positive matrix factorization were used to identify and quantify the pollution sources. The average BVs of chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn) were 81.3, 41.4, 41.4, 16.6, 0.34, 43.7, and 118.0 mg kg-1, respectively. In FI, SI, and TI, soils were highly contaminated with Cd, Pb, Zn, and As, derived primarily from wastewater irrigation, occupying 58-73%; and Cr, Ni, and Cu mainly from natural sources, occupying 62-89%. UI was slightly contaminated with Cu, Cd, and Pb, derived mainly from atmospheric deposition (38-52%) and natural sources (34-44%). Cadmium posed high potential ecological risks in FI (93%) and SI (96%), and Cd and As represented a health risk to children in irrigated regions. Soil remediation should be prioritized in FI, then in SI and TI; Cd should be targeted first, followed by Pb, As, Cu and Zn. This systems approach offers scalable solutions for global mining landscapes threatened by legacy pollution and evolving irrigation practices.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-22">摘要</h3>
<p>Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and fluorinated ionic liquids were investigated in municipal effluents from 30 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) across 15 European countries using supercritical fluid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (SFC-HRMS) for nontarget screening. Bis-perfluoroalkyl sulfonimide (bis-FASI) ionic liquids were detected as bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (NTf2-), two rarely reported homologues (±2 CF2, namely FSI- and BETI-), and two previously unreported homologues (±1 CF2, namely FTFSI- and FTNTf2-). Bis-FASIs were present in 85% of samples and were more abundant in effluents from larger WWTPs. The fluorinated anion PF6-, commonly used in ionic liquids, was found in all samples (≤3 μg/L). Hexafluoroarsenate (AsF6-), reported here for the first time in municipal wastewater, was detected in 32% of samples in eight countries. PF6- and AsF6- concentrations exceeded those of traditional PFSAs and PFCAs in 97% of the samples. No removal was detected for perfluorinated compounds, inorganic anions, and low-fluorinated pharmaceuticals and pesticides. Low-fluorinated substances were detected in 90% of samples (&gt;100 ng/L), yet PF6- alone surpassed the combined concentration of all low-fluorinated substances in 27 out of 30 samples. These results reveal the significance of unconventional fluorinated substances for the overall fluorine load in wastewater, highlighting the need to extend monitoring strategies beyond legacy PFAS.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-23">摘要</h3>
<p>Quitting smoking, or nicotine deprivation, is associated with withdrawal symptoms, including increased pain sensitivity and hyperalgesia through poorly managed current therapies, thus highlighting the need to improve our knowledge of pain mechanisms and their management during nicotine withdrawal, or smoking cessation states.
In this context, the present study investigates the role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), inflammation, and redox balance in the cerebral cortex of adult rats exposed to oral nicotine and passive cigarette smoking through a whole-body inhalation chamber for short- and long-term exposure, where doses closely mimic the human smoking scenario. A subset of the exposure group received a single dose of mecamylamine hydrochloride, a nicotine acetylcholine receptor blocker, to evaluate the precipitated withdrawal effects as contributors to hyperalgesia and neuropathic pain.
The results reveal that nicotine/cigarette smoking induces hyperalgesia, lowers pain tolerance, and upregulates BDNF expression in adult rats as compared to the unexposed healthy controls. Mecamylamine mitigates the negative effects of nicotine by modulating neural circuits of the cerebral cortex involved in pain and inflammation. Specifically, mecamylamine changes cytokine dynamics by upregulating interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression, restoring redox balance, and downregulating BDNF and its receptor, Trk-β, in the cerebral cortex, thereby exacerbating pain sensitivity and ameliorating pain tolerance.
The BDNF-Trk-β/IL-6 cascade in the cerebral cortex may prevent nicotine relapse by alleviating hyperalgesia and neuropathic pain during smoking cessation/nicotine withdrawal.
Tobacco use is almost double in chronic pain patients, where opioid-based drugs cause more addiction burden. The study provides an insight into potential non-opioid therapeutic strategies targeting the BDNF-Trk-β/IL-6 cascade in the cerebral cortex, the higher center of behavioral activities, using adult rodent models where nicotine doses closely mimic the human smoking situation, including passive cigarette smoking and oral nicotine use. The data of the study may be useful for neuropathic pain management during nicotine withdrawal/smoking cessation and quitting efforts.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-25">摘要</h3>
<p>A quarter of US adults face mental health challenges, yet less than half receive treatment, partly due to therapist shortages. Scaling trained paraprofessionals to provide effective care could address this gap. We evaluated the impact of evidence-based coaching within a real-world blended care digital mental health platform. 266 working adults (62% women, Mage=33 years, 40% people of color) newly enrolled (2021-2022) in the platform (Modern Health) completed surveys at baseline and 3-months. Participants primarily engaged with certified professional coaches and could also access therapy and digital resources. We examined pre-post changes in outcomes and differences by baseline clinical status. Participants used an average of 2.5 coaching sessions and improved in distress tolerance (+ 4.1%), perceived stress (-8.4%), self-compassion (+ 5.9%), and mindfulness (+ 2.6%) (ps &lt; 0.01). Although elevated risk users (vs. lower risk) reported descriptively greater improvements in distress tolerance (+ 4.7% vs. +3.7%), perceived stress (-10% vs. -3.7%), self-compassion (+ 7.6% vs. +5.2%), and mindfulness (+ 3.3% vs. +2.1%), these differences were not statistically significant (ps &gt; 0.05). Depression (-22.5%) and anxiety (-12%) improved (ps &lt; 0.001), with elevated risk users reporting greater reductions (b=-3.15, p &lt; .001 for depression; b=-2.61, p &lt; .001 for anxiety). Among elevated risk users, 71.7% improved or recovered from depression or anxiety and 96.1% of lower risk users maintained lower depression and anxiety. Technology-enabled coaching, as part of a blended care platform, improved depression, anxiety, and transdiagnostic emotional processes. Participants with higher baseline depression and anxiety reported greater improvements, highlighting coaching’s effectiveness for people with elevated needs. By redefining care and leveraging technology, coaching may be a scalable treatment solution.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-26">摘要</h3>
<p>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has emerged as a critical global health challenge, exacerbated by the interconnected dynamics of human, animal, and environmental health systems. The “One Health” approach, which integrates these domains, offers a comprehensive framework for addressing AMR at its roots. This review explores the environmental dimension of AMR by examining the role of environmental microbiomes as reservoirs and transmission vectors of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs). It highlights emerging evidence, transmission pathways, detection methodologies, and policy gaps, with an emphasis on low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). An in-depth literature synthesis was conducted across environmental, clinical, and molecular microbiology studies to understand the eco-evolutionary dynamics of resistance, routes of ARG transmission, and effectiveness of current surveillance models. Emphasis was placed on novel detection technologies and integrated policy frameworks. Environmental resistomes present in soil, water, air, and waste play a pivotal yet underappreciated role in ARG dissemination via horizontal gene transfer, mobile genetic elements, and co-selectors like heavy metals and biocides. The complexity of microbial communities in diverse ecological matrices fosters the persistence and evolution of resistance. Current surveillance systems often neglect environmental inputs, particularly in LMICs, limiting the effectiveness of AMR mitigation efforts. A paradigm shift is required to recognize the environmental microbiome as a central component of AMR. Integrated “One Health” strategies, improved environmental surveillance, policy reforms, and novel technological interventions are critical for global AMR control. Bridging the research-policy gap and empowering local surveillance infrastructure can significantly enhance resistance management and public health outcomes.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-27">摘要</h3>
<p>Germany has the highest density of cigarette vending machines globally, and the recent proliferation of electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) vending machines raises growing public health concerns, particularly regarding youth exposure. However, limited data exist on their spatial distribution and contextual placement. This study presents the first spatial analysis of e-cigarette vending machines in Germany, using the Berlin-based company ‘Vape4Me’ as a case study.
Geo-referenced data on e-cigarette vending machine locations were extracted from the Vape4Me website and cross-validated using Google Maps and Microsoft Bing Maps. Spatial analyses-including density mapping, proximity assessments and co-location analysis-were conducted using ArcGIS Pro, R and OpenRouteService. Associations with population size were examined through regression analysis. Selected sites in Cologne and Wiesbaden were visited for on-site validation.
A total of 316 (Vape4Me) e-cigarette vending machines were identified in Germany, with the highest concentration in Berlin. Machine density was significantly associated with population size, with a 3.24% increase per 1000 additional residents. In Berlin, vending machines were frequently co-located with hospitality and commercial establishments and rarely placed near outdoor or public utility areas. On-site inspections revealed that machines offered disposable e-cigarettes for around €10, with basic age verification.
The integration of e-cigarette vending machines into everyday environments-combined with continuous advertising and 24/7 access-normalises e-cigarette use and poses challenges to tobacco control efforts. Stronger regulations, including bans on the sale of cigarettes and e-cigarettes via vending machines, are urgently needed to protect youth from early nicotine exposure.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-28">摘要</h3>
<p>Obesity-related alterations in the gut microbiota have been linked to cognitive decline, yet their relationship with attention remains poorly understood.
To evaluate the possible relationships among gut metagenomics, plasma metabolomics and attention.
We conducted faecal shotgun metagenomics and targeted plasma tryptophan metabolomics across three independent cohorts (n=156, n=124, n=804) with functional validations in preclinical models, including three faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments in mice and Drosophila melanogaster.
Obesity was consistently associated with reduced attention. Metagenomics analyses identified Proteobacteria species and microbial functions related to tryptophan biosynthesis from anthranilic acid (AA) as negatively associated with attention in obesity. Plasma tryptophan metabolic profiling and machine learning revealed that 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA) was positively associated with attention, particularly in obesity, while AA showed a negative association. Bariatric surgery improved attention and enriched microbial species linked to attention. In mice, diet-induced obesity (DIO) and microbiota depletion reduced 3-HAA and 5-hydroxy-indole acetic acid (5-HIAA) concentrations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which were restored by FMT. Global metabolic profiling (&gt;600 metabolites) of PFC from the FMT group identified 3-HAA and the tryptophan and tyrosine pathways among the most significant in mice receiving microbiota from high-attention donors. A second FMT experiment also revealed a consistent enrichment of the tryptophan and tyrosine metabolism at the transcriptional level in the PFC, with Haao (3-hydroxyantrhanilic acid dioxygenase) and Aox4 (aldehyde oxidase 4), key in 3-HAA and 5-HIAA degradation, among the significantly regulated genes. In a third FMT study, attentional traits were transmitted from humans to mice alongside modulation of serotonergic and dopaminergic pathways. In Drosophila, mono-colonisation with Enterobacter cloacae and DIO induced attention deficit-like behaviours, which were mitigated by 3-HAA supplementation.
We have identified the microbiota and 3-HAA as potential therapeutic targets to improve attention, especially in obesity.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-29">摘要</h3>
<p>Skeletal muscle disuse leads to atrophy. Accumulating evidence suggests that angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) contributes to sex-dependent catabolic signaling. However, the direct role of AT1R in skeletal muscle is unclear. This study investigated whether selective suppression of AT1R expression in the rat soleus muscle via adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9)-mediated short hairpin RNA (shRNA) delivery could mitigate hindlimb unloading (HU)-induced muscle atrophy, and whether this effect differed between male and female rats. Male and female rats received intramuscular injections of AAV9 vectors encoding AT1R-targeted shRNA into the soleus muscle. After 7 d of HU, AT1R gene copy number (digital PCR), receptor abundance (ligand binding assay), muscle fiber cross-sectional area (CSA), and downstream molecular markers (including phosphorylated Smad2/3 and Smad1/5/8, HDAC4 expression, and the atrogenes, Fbxo32 and Trim63) were assessed. Female rats exhibited substantially higher AT1R gene copy numbers, which were selectively reduced by AAV9-shRNA. Ligand binding confirmed reduced receptor abundance in both sexes. CSA loss attenuation was observed exclusively in females, particularly in type I fibers. In female animals, AT1R knockdown substantially increased Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation and decreased HDAC4 expression. The AT1R copy number was positively correlated with Fbxo32 and Trim63 expression, independent of AAV dose. AT1R plays a sex-specific role in disuse-induced muscle atrophy, as muscle-specific AT1R knockdown conferred selective protection in female rats. The effect appears to be mediated via Smad1/5/8-HDAC4 signaling rather than oxidative stress or autophagy. This study provides mechanistic support for sex-informed therapeutic strategies targeting the muscle-localized renin-angiotensin system.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-30">摘要</h3>
<p>Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide and is predominantly diagnosed in older adults, underscoring the need to explore aging-related biological mechanisms that influence disease progression and prognosis. Cellular senescence, a hallmark of aging, plays a dual role in cancer by contributing to both tumor suppression and tumor promotion through its influence on tumor growth, modulation of the tumor microenvironment, the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), and response to therapy. In this study, we evaluated the prognostic significance of senescence-related gene expression in lung cancer using three independent gene signatures, including the SenMayo gene set and two additional curated lists. Transcriptomic and clinical data from publicly available datasets were analyzed using Cox regression, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and multivariate modeling. All three senescence signatures were significantly associated with overall survival, with the SenMayo signature showing the most robust and consistent prognostic power. Notably, higher expression of senescence-associated genes was associated with improved survival in the overall lung cancer cohort and in lung adenocarcinoma, while a more heterogeneous pattern emerged in squamous cell carcinoma. Although hazard ratios varied among the gene sets, their broadly concordant associations with clinical outcomes highlight the biological relevance and context dependence of senescence in lung cancer. These findings suggest that senescence-associated gene expression may serve as a valuable prognostic biomarker and offer mechanistic insights into tumor behavior. Our results contribute to the growing body of gero-oncology research and emphasize the need for tumor-specific exploration of aging-related processes in cancer.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-32">摘要</h3>
<p>Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the deadliest infectious diseases worldwide, causing millions of new cases and deaths annually. Rapid and accurate TB diagnostics are essential for TB control, yet current methods do not fully meet global needs. Peripheral blood neutrophils play a critical role in TB infection and represent a promising source of diagnostic markers.
We conducted a cross-sectional proteomic analysis to characterise neutrophil protein profiles in individuals with active TB (ATB), latent TB infection (LTBI), and healthy controls (HC). Stringent criteria were applied to identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) among these groups. Transcriptomic data were integrated to perform pathway enrichment analysis of DEPs. Three DEPs (B2M, TXN, and PRDX5) were further validated as candidate diagnostic biomarkers for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection using automated western blotting in a cohort of 319 individuals, including 71 ATB, 142 LTBI, and 106 HC.
Hundreds of DEPs were identified across the three groups. Integrated transcriptomic analysis revealed significant enrichment of DEPs in the NOD-like receptor signalling pathway. Receiver operating characteristic analysis of the three-protein combination (B2M, TXN, and PRDX5) yielded an area under the curve of 0.9847, with a sensitivity of 95.11% and a specificity of 96.23% for detecting MTB infection.
This study presents a comprehensive proteomic profile of neutrophils under different MTB infection states, and this three-protein combination may assist in the diagnosis of MTB infection.

<h3 id="摘要-34">摘要</h3>
<p>Engaging community collaborators in research is crucial for enhancing health care outcomes, especially for cerebral palsy (CP). However, effective multi-collaborator involvement poses challenges. This study used an occupation-based approach to engage community collaborators in developing a CP Task Force to initiate patient-centered comparative clinical effectiveness research and evaluated member perspectives on roles and experiences. A repeated cross-sectional design was employed, with 18 CP Task Force members completing 39 surveys. Engagement activities focused on social participation, leisure, play, education, and work. Surveys assessed team culture, trust, and role satisfaction. Descriptive statistics analyzed survey data, while thematic analysis summarized qualitative responses. Participants reported high satisfaction and engagement. Key themes included inclusivity, effective communication, accessibility, and expanded engagement. Occupation-based engagement can enhance collaboration, build rapport, and create a shared sense of purpose among multi-collaborators when establishing a CP Task Force to support patient-centered comparative clinical effectiveness research.
Involving Families and Caregivers in Research to Improve Care for Children with Cerebral PalsyResearch that involves families, caregivers, and others with experience in caring for children with cerebral palsy (CP) is essential for improving the research that leads to valuable treatments and outcomes. However, it can be difficult to effectively include these voices in the research process. This study aimed to find a better way to involve the people most affected by CP—children, families, caregivers, and professionals—in research that will help improve care and treatment. The study created a task force with collaborators who provided various perspectives, including those who care for children with CP. The task force focused on everyday activities that are meaningful and essential to people’s lives, such as play, school, and work, an approach grounded in occupational therapy, known as an occupation-based approach. The group met regularly to work together to start a group that supports research that considers the unique needs and experiences of children with CP. The study showed that task force participants were very satisfied with their involvement, feeling that their contributions were valued. They also highlighted the importance of inclusivity, good communication, and expanding access to ensure everyone can participate. The results suggest that using an occupation-based approach to engage families and caregivers to create a task force can help make multi-collaborator engagement in research more relevant, ensuring that collaborators feel comfortable and valued as members of the research team. This approach can be an important tool for occupational therapists and health care researchers to facilitate better involvement of all collaborators in clinical research.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-35">摘要</h3>
<p>To examine the association between drinking patterns and subsequent antidepressant medication using register-linked data.
The Helsinki Health Study survey (2000-02) of 40- to 60-year-old employees was linked with antidepressant medication data from registers of the Social Insurance Institution of Finland. Drinking patterns included weekly amount of drinking, binge drinking and problem drinking. Cox regression analysis was used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) for the first antidepressant medication purchase during five-year follow-up. Gender, age, occupational position, marital status, relative weight, smoking and leisure-time physical activity were included as covariates. The study included 5727 employees with no antidepressant purchase during 3 years preceding the baseline.
Heavy drinking was associated with an increased risk of antidepressant medication compared to moderate drinking (HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.18-1.99). Non-drinkers (1.43, 1.03-1.97), occasional binge drinkers (1.27, 1.06-1.52) and frequent binge drinkers (1.35 (1.02-1.77) showed an association with antidepressant medication compared to non-bingeing drinkers. Problem drinking was associated with antidepressant medication (1.84, 1.54-2.19). The associations remained after adjusting for occupational position and for marital status. The associations concerning heavy drinking and problem drinking remained also after adjusting for relative weight and health behaviours. An additional analysis among participants with prior antidepressant medication before baseline, showed no associations between drinking patterns and subsequent antidepressant medication during the follow-up.
Alcohol drinking is associated with antidepressant medication among employees. The association is not limited to problem drinking. Paying attention to heavy, binge and problem drinking might help prevent depression.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-36">摘要</h3>
<p>Exposure to bioaerosols from salmon processing is associated with occupational asthma. The prevalence of work-related asthma symptoms in fish processing workers has earlier been reported to be 12%-24%, but small sample sizes and heterogeneity in exposure across studies make generalisability to todays’ salmon processing industry questionable. Studies comparing filleting workers and slaughtering workers have shown conflicting results.
Questionnaire and spirometry data from workers in nine different salmon processing plants were gathered during 2021-2023. Exposure to salmon bioaerosols was defined by work tasks and total time working with salmon. Asthma symptoms and lung function were compared between exposure groups using logistic regression and adjusting for relevant confounding variables.
Of the 867 workers regularly or variably exposed to salmon bioaerosols, 170 (20%) had work-related asthma symptoms. Exposure was associated with symptoms, but not with lung function. Of the 440 exposed workers with spirometry data, 9.8% had expiratory airflow limitation, and all mean lung function measures were below the reference values. The prevalence of work-related asthma symptoms was slightly higher among gutting workers than filleting workers (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.8).
The prevalence of work-related asthma symptoms is high in salmon processing, probably due to bioaerosol exposure. Salmon processing workers had more expiratory airflow limitation and lower lung function compared with the reference values. Although gutting workers had slightly higher risk for work-related asthma symptoms than filleting workers, all exposed workers seem to be at risk and preventive measures should be taken in all areas where bioaerosols are present.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-37">摘要</h3>
<p>The precision estimation on prevalence of anti-HCV was 2.86 % in Taiwan. Studies have shown that iatrogenic behavior was the major transmission route in geriatric patients. Moreover, it is highest in the specific groups including end stage renal disease during hemodialysis, human immunodeficiency virus infection, person who inject drug (PWID), and those under opioid substitution therapy. The estimated chronic hepatitis C (CHC; HCV RNA positive) patients were 188,126 who need to be treated. Taiwan has accelerated its efforts to eliminate HCV infection since 2017, and the government claims to reach the programmatic and impact targets set by WHO indicating HCV elimination by 2025. The most important and successful factor is government will. The Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) conquer several barriers of diagnosis and linkage to care including finance a national program, implementing a harm reduction program, expanding treatment capacity beyond specialists, remove treatment restriction, implement monitoring and evaluation, implement awareness and national screening program and implement national link-to-care program during 2017-2024. Fortunately, the calculated diagnostic and treatment rates are 90.6 % and 92.8 % respectively in the general population and achieve full HCV elimination programmatic targets which is diagnostic rate &gt;90 % and treatment rates &gt;80 % based on the WHO definition.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-38">摘要</h3>
<p>Objective: To explore the surgical efficacy of high position dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) under nasal endoscopy in patients with chronic dacryocystitis secondary to failure of nasolacrimal duct stent implantation. Methods: A total of 101 patients with chronic dacryocystitis who were treated at People’s Hospital of Peking University from 2013 to 2024 were retrospectively selected, including 14 males and 87 females, aged (56.82±13.00) years (Mean±SD). The patients were divided into control group (53 cases, 59 eyes) and stent group (48 cases, 60 eyes). The control group consisted of randomly selected patients with simple dacryocystitis, while, the stent group included patients with secondary dacryocystitis after failure of nasolacrimal duct stent implantation. All patients underwent endoscopic high DCR with exposed the Rosenmüller valve, combined with intraoperative lacrimal silicone tube implantation. After the operation, the surgical efficacy was evaluated by methods such as Munk score, endoscopic observation of intranasal ostia, lacrimal duct irrigation, and fluorescein test. SPSS 27.0 software was used for data statistics. Results: All 101 patients were followed up for at least one year after DCR surgery. In the control group, one patient (two eyes) was lost to follow-up; while, in the stent group, three patients (three eyes) were lost to follow-up, with one case diagnosed with lacrimal sac cancer. Excluding the lost-to-follow-up cases and the patient with lacrimal sac cancer, anatomical success was achieved in 54 eyes (96.4%, 54/56) in the stent group, and both anatomical and functional success in 53 eyes (94.6%, 53/56); in the control group, 55 eyes (96.5%, 55/57) achieved both anatomical and functional success. No statistically significant difference was found in postoperative effectiveness efficacy between the two groups (χ2=0.000, P=0.984). Conclusion: For patients with secondary dacryocystitis after nasolacrimal duct stent implantation, high position DCR with exposure of Rosenmüller valve combined with lacrimal duct silicone intubation can achieve better long-term efficacy.

<h3 id="摘要-39">摘要</h3>
<p>This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccination for older adults in the Netherlands, aiming to identify the most effective vaccination strategy.
A static decision tree cost-effectiveness model was developed to compare no vaccination with various RSV vaccination strategies for Dutch adults over six RSV seasons. Strategies included vaccinating adults aged ≥60, ≥75, and ≥75 combined with high-risk individuals aged 60-74. Each was assessed with two- and three-year intervals. The model incorporated health outcomes and costs associated with RSV disease and vaccination from a societal perspective, with a lifetime horizon. Recent incidence data were used, and vaccine effectiveness was based on efficacy from a meta-analysis for outpatient settings and real-world effectiveness data for inpatient settings. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted, using a €50,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) willingness-to-pay threshold.
Vaccinating individuals aged ≥75 years and high-risk groups every three years could prevent approximately 19,000 general practitioner visits, 3300 hospitalizations (including 245 intensive care admissions), and 870 deaths in the first year. This strategy would avoid €29.5 million in healthcare costs and €6.3 million in productivity losses, gaining 2900 QALYs. It was cost-effective, with an average cost-effectiveness ratio (ACER) of €30,804/QALY. The most cost-effective strategy was vaccinating ≥75 year-olds every three years, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 23,080/QALY compared to no vaccination. Vaccinating all ≥60-year-olds every three years resulted in the highest QALY gain, with an ACER of €39,918/QALY. Compared to the ≥75 and high-risk strategy, this approach had an ICER of €107,623/QALY, whereas the 75+ and high-risk strategy had an ICER of €61,987/QALY compared to the ≥75 strategy alone. Biennial strategies were associated with higher ACERs and were dominated in incremental comparisons.
RSV vaccination for older adults in the Netherlands can be cost-effective, particularly when vaccinating every three years.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-40">摘要</h3>
<p>General Practitioners (GPs) play a crucial role across the cancer continuum, from prevention and early detection to end-of-life care. GPs provide comprehensive care that addresses a broad spectrum of health issues rather than a specific disease. Elements such as person-centeredness, continuity of care and whole-person care define the specialty of general practice. Other characteristics, such as expertise in managing uncertainty, undifferentiated illness and complexity, care coordination and teamwork, facilitate its evolution as a specialty.
This paper uses the Caring Life-Course Theory as a theoretical framework to discuss the role of GPs in cancer care. We explore the barriers and enablers of providing optimal care in general practice for people diagnosed with cancer on an micro-, meso- and macro-level using the Caring Life-Course Theory.
The fundamentals of care framework aligns with the key characteristics of general practice namely first contact care, comprehensive care, continuity of care, person-centeredness and whole-person care. General practice is underpinned by a long-term therapeutic partnership with the patient, the ability to meet a range of care needs simultaneously, and an understanding of the context in which care is taking place. GPs provide care across the life course, facilitate self-care, care from others and care for others, assess care needs at transitions during the cancer continuum, and maintain a detailed care biography of the patient.
Adequate funding of longer consultations to facilitate the delivery of complex care, and expansion of multidisciplinary primary care teams, is required to sustain the delivery of quality cancer care in general practice.
There is significant opportunity to enhance the role of primary care nursing in delivery of cancer care in general practice, but this must be supported by enablers across all levels of care delivery.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-41">摘要</h3>
<p>Despite the outstanding efforts of the international organizations in implementing global policies, the upward trend of antimicrobial consumption (AMC) and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the last biennium, after a slight decline throughout the last decade, has been resonating like a warning worldwide. Furthermore, the impact of emerging contaminants including antibiotics in the environment should not be underestimated, since they contribute to antibiotic-resistant mechanisms. Their aquatic environment occurrence, often resulting from misuse and incapability of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs)-where available-to completely remove these compounds could pose a risk to living organisms. Built on a One Health-basis and aimed at serving as reference point for scientists to cover the gaps of chemical occurrence data and to address future researches on less studied sites, this review has examined 6305 occurrence concentration data for 142 antibiotics (including transformation products and metabolites) across 76 countries and 6 continents during 2014-2024 in groundwater and surface water. Data distribution was different being surface water 7 times more represented than groundwater, while Europe and Asia the continents with the highest publication rates. Sulfonamides were the most investigated unlike carbapenems and polymyxins. Low- and Middle- Income Countries (LMICs) reported the highest cumulative concentrations peaking at 781.98 ng/L, while trace levels in Antarctica, rich in migratory phenomena, have risen scientific interests in understanding early-stage zoonotic interactions. Antibiotic occurrence also depends on the fate and degradation mechanisms in the aquatic media, but degradation products are rarely studied. Considering that their toxicity is yet to be evaluated, analytical efforts are recommended in the farsighted perspective to perform a comprehensive environmental risk assessment of these emerging contaminants at the earliest.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-42">摘要</h3>
<p>Early-life determinants of middle-age cardiovascular health are poorly understood. This study examines associations of body mass index (BMI) and physical fitness in male adolescents with cardiovascular health measured by the Life’s Essential 8 score in middle age.
A population-based cohort study linked BMI and physical fitness from the Swedish Military Conscription Register (men conscripted 1972-1987) to cardiovascular health from the Swedish CArdioPulmonary bioImage Study (SCAPIS, 2013-2018). In 2025, 8930 men (mean age 18.3 years) were analyzed after 38.2 years of follow-up. Physical fitness included cardiorespiratory fitness (maximal cycle-ergometer test), and muscular strength (isometric dynamometry of knee extension, elbow flexion, and handgrip). Cardiovascular health was evaluated using the American Heart Association Life’s Essential 8 score (0-100; poor health &lt;60). Associations were assessed using linear and binomial logistic regressions and restricted cubic splines.
BMI and cardiorespiratory fitness exhibited J-shaped and linear associations, respectively, with cardiovascular health. Compared to normal weight (BMI: 18.5-24.9 kg/m2), adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of having poor cardiovascular health for overweight (BMI: 25.0-29.9 kg/m2) and obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) were OR 2.42 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.00-2.92) and OR 5.38 (95% CI 2.99-9.70). No statistically significant associations were observed between muscular strength and cardiovascular health.
Obesity and low levels of cardiorespiratory fitness in male adolescents were associated with lower cardiovascular health in middle age, after nearly four decades of follow-up. Although further studies are needed, promotion of a healthy body weight and cardiorespiratory fitness in youth may be of importance for later cardiovascular health.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-43">摘要</h3>
<p>Congenital structural malformations (CSM) have become a significant public health and social issue, affecting the health status of children and the level of population quality. Emerging research increasingly suggests that environmental pollutants may contribute to the development of CSM. However, current epidemiologic evidence on the effects of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) on CSM is limited and restrictive. A nested case-control study examined how maternal exposure to PFAS during pregnancy affects the risk of CSM. Logistic regression and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) were used to assess the effects of single PFAS and PFAS mixture exposure on CSM. Perfluorodecanoic acid (PDA) showed a strong positive association with CSM in the logistic regression model (Adjusted OR: 4.79, 95% CI: 1.55 ~ 18.52). The BKMR analysis indicated an increased risk of CSM as PFAS mixture levels rose above the 55th percentile. Individual PFAS were ranked by posterior inclusion probabilities (PIPs), with PDA (PIP = 1.00), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) (PIP = 1.00), potassium 9-chlorohexadecafluoro-3-oxanonane-1-sulfonate (9Cl_PF3ONS) (PIP = 0.88), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) (PIP = 0.82) contributing most to the mixture’s effect on CSM. No significant interactions were observed between PFAS mixtures when other exposures were held constant at the 50th percentile. In conclusion, we found that prenatal exposure to PDA and PFAS mixtures was significantly linked to a heightened risk of CSM, with PDA, PFOA, 9Cl_PF3ONS, and PFNA being significant contributors to the mixture effect. In addition, our study did not identify any previous interactions of PFAS.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-44">摘要</h3>
<p>Work-related injuries often occur to fingers, hands, and wrists (FHW); however, research on risk factors is limited. The study aim was to analyze (in 2024) national estimates and trends of work-related FHW Emergency Department (ED)-treated traumatic injuries (2015-2022).
The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-Occupational Supplement was used to analyze FHW injuries. Estimates and rates per 10,000 full-time equivalent workers were calculated using employment labor force estimates from the Current Population Survey. Patterns of injury severity and identification of at-risk populations were calculated including adjusting for industry.
Nearly five million work-related ED-treated injuries were FHW with 2% severe. Two-thirds (67%) of these injuries were among males, however females had higher odds of severe injuries than males when adjusting for industry. Rates of injury decreased with increasing age groups, however adjusting for industry found a higher likelihood of injuries among older age groups. Healthcare and social assistance workers experienced the highest number of FHW injuries (814,100 injuries). However, accommodation/food service workers had the highest injury rates (81 per 10,000 FTE). Construction (24%) and manufacturing (23%) workers had the highest percentage of severe FHW. However, the highest rates for severe FHW injury rates were agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting and construction (35.3 and 23.4 per 100,000 FTE workers). Injury rates declined significantly from 2015-2021, then increased in 2022.
These findings improve understanding of work-related FHW injury risks. Industry specific surveillance and targeted interventions for high-risk industries like construction and manufacturing could assist in reducing FHW injuries.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-46">摘要</h3>
<p>Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects the dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia. It leads to a range of motor symptoms such as tremors, bradykinesia, rigidity, and gait instability. A significant, but often overlooked, sequela of PD is osteoporosis, which contributes to a higher incidence of fractures. This risk is exacerbated by both PD itself as well as the medications used to manage PD. Despite the heightened risk of fragility fractures, osteoporosis in PD is frequently under-recognized and inadequately managed.
This review aimed to explore the current literature on osteoporosis management strategies specifically for individuals with PD.
MEDLINE, Scopus, and EMBASE were searched from database inception to August 10, 2025.
Following a two-stage review process conducted by two independent reviewers, 18 relevant articles were identified. Of these, 17 were review articles and one was an interventional study. The literature most commonly identified lifestyle modifications, pharmacological treatments, and surgical interventions as management strategies for osteoporosis in PD. However, most of the recommendations were based on research conducted in the general population, raising concerns about their effectiveness for individuals with PD, who may have unique clinical needs.
We note a significant gap in research focused on osteoporosis management in PD patients. Research efforts should prioritize developing tailored strategies to manage osteoporosis in individuals with PD.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-47">摘要</h3>
<p>Cancer is a leading cause of death globally. Accurate cancer burden information is crucial for policy planning, but many countries do not have up-to-date cancer surveillance data. To inform global cancer-control efforts, we used the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2023 framework to generate and analyse estimates of cancer burden for 47 cancer types or groupings by age, sex, and 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2023, cancer burden attributable to selected risk factors from 1990 to 2023, and forecasted cancer burden up to 2050.
Cancer estimation in GBD 2023 used data from population-based cancer registration systems, vital registration systems, and verbal autopsies. Cancer mortality was estimated using ensemble models, with incidence informed by mortality estimates and mortality-to-incidence ratios (MIRs). Prevalence estimates were generated from modelled survival estimates, then multiplied by disability weights to estimate years lived with disability (YLDs). Years of life lost (YLLs) were estimated by multiplying age-specific cancer deaths by the GBD standard life expectancy at the age of death. Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were calculated as the sum of YLLs and YLDs. We used the GBD 2023 comparative risk assessment framework to estimate cancer burden attributable to 44 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risk factors. To forecast cancer burden from 2024 to 2050, we used the GBD 2023 forecasting framework, which included forecasts of relevant risk factor exposures and used Socio-demographic Index as a covariate for forecasting the proportion of each cancer not affected by these risk factors. Progress towards the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 3.4 aim to reduce non-communicable disease mortality by a third between 2015 and 2030 was estimated for cancer.
In 2023, excluding non-melanoma skin cancers, there were 18·5 million (95% uncertainty interval 16·4 to 20·7) incident cases of cancer and 10·4 million (9·65 to 10·9) deaths, contributing to 271 million (255 to 285) DALYs globally. Of these, 57·9% (56·1 to 59·8) of incident cases and 65·8% (64·3 to 67·6) of cancer deaths occurred in low-income to upper-middle-income countries based on World Bank income group classifications. Cancer was the second leading cause of deaths globally in 2023 after cardiovascular diseases. There were 4·33 million (3·85 to 4·78) risk-attributable cancer deaths globally in 2023, comprising 41·7% (37·8 to 45·4) of all cancer deaths. Risk-attributable cancer deaths increased by 72·3% (57·1 to 86·8) from 1990 to 2023, whereas overall global cancer deaths increased by 74·3% (62·2 to 86·2) over the same period. The reference forecasts (the most likely future) estimate that in 2050 there will be 30·5 million (22·9 to 38·9) cases and 18·6 million (15·6 to 21·5) deaths from cancer globally, 60·7% (41·9 to 80·6) and 74·5% (50·1 to 104·2) increases from 2024, respectively. These forecasted increases in deaths are greater in low-income and middle-income countries (90·6% [61·0 to 127·0]) compared with high-income countries (42·8% [28·3 to 58·6]). Most of these increases are likely due to demographic changes, as age-standardised death rates are forecast to change by -5·6% (-12·8 to 4·6) between 2024 and 2050 globally. Between 2015 and 2030, the probability of dying due to cancer between the ages of 30 years and 70 years was forecasted to have a relative decrease of 6·5% (3·2 to 10·3).
Cancer is a major contributor to global disease burden, with increasing numbers of cases and deaths forecasted up to 2050 and a disproportionate growth in burden in countries with scarce resources. The decline in age-standardised mortality rates from cancer is encouraging but insufficient to meet the SDG target set for 2030. Effectively and sustainably addressing cancer burden globally will require comprehensive national and international efforts that consider health systems and context in the development and implementation of cancer-control strategies across the continuum of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

<h2 id="article-49">49. Inpatient boarding in the emergency departments and clinical outcomes: A propensity-matched study.</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: The American journal of emergency medicine
<strong>发表日期</strong>: 2025-Sep-23
<strong>链接</strong>: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41016086">PubMed</a></p>

<h3 id="摘要-48">摘要</h3>
<p>The study evaluated clinical outcomes in patients who experienced inpatient boarding in the ED (boarders) compared to those admitted directly (non-boarders).
Retrospective propensity-matched study of consecutive adults presented to 22 emergency departments and were subsequently admitted to 17 hospitals across Southeast Minnesota. The exposure variable was ED boarding. ED boarding was defined as patients flagged by ED physicians for admission and awaiting an inpatient bed, regardless of the time to flagging. The primary outcomes were length of hospital stay (LOS) and in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcome was all-cause mortality within 90 days after hospitalization. Boarders were matched to non-boarders using 86 covariates. Poisson, logistic, and Cox regression models were used to assess associations, with subgroup analyses by age, sex, and ED location.
From April 1, 2019, to March 30, 2024, 821,244 ED visits and 151,834 (26.9 %) admissions. Of these, 3173 (1.9 %) were boarders (median time: 4.2 h; IQR, 1.8-9.7). Boarding was not associated with in-hospital mortality (OR, 0.84; 95 % CI, 0.59-1.20; P = 0.340) or LOS (IRR, 1.02; 95 % CI, 0.99-1.04; P = 0.088), but was associated with higher 90-day mortality (HR, 1.30; 95 % CI, 1.15-1.46; P = 0.005). These findings were consistent across age, sex, and ED location.
In this multicenter, propensity score-matched study, ED boarding was not associated with LOS or in-hospital mortality but was associated with a 1.3-fold increase in 90-day mortality, consistent across age, sex, and ED location.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-49">摘要</h3>
<p>Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are essential for controlling antimicrobial resistance, but also serve as hotspots for resistance gene persistence and dissemination. In this study, a novel combinatory approach using genome-resolved metagenomics and metatranscriptomics was employed to examine the resistome of a full-scale municipal WWTP across treatment stages and seasons. Results reveal that although human-associated, potentially pathogenic, antibiotic resistance gene (ARG)-harbouring metagenome-assembled genomes (ARBMAGs) declined in abundance during treatment, many ARGs remained transcriptionally active, particularly efflux, beta-lactam, and macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin genes conferring resistance against fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, and macrolides. Environment and treatment-adapted microbes become increasingly dominant, with plasmids identified as major vectors of mobile resistance. Dominant potential pathogenic human-associated ARBMAGs were abundant during spring and summer, whereas environmental ARBMAGs predominated in colder seasons. Fluoroquinolone resistance genes displayed varying expression levels across ARBMAG types, with the lowest levels observed during the anaerobic phase of treatment. Although clinically relevant ARGs were detected at low relative abundance and expression levels, one of the carriers was Citrobacter freundii ARBMAG, a human-associated potential pathogen. These findings underscore the value of integrating genomic and transcriptomic data to assess site-specific and ARBMAG-type-specific resistance and to strengthen antibiotic resistance monitoring in engineered systems.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-51">摘要</h3>
<p>Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is characterized by metabolic dysregulation and mitochondrial dysfunction that are in part driven by elevated glucose. This study assessed the metabolic changes in the renal proximal tubule in the early onset of DKD. Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of the β2-adrenoceptor agonist formoterol in reversing metabolic disruptions in diabetic mouse kidneys. Metabolomic analysis using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry detected 270 biochemicals in each sample. Thirteen-week-old diabetic db/db mice treated with vehicle were characterized by increased aromatic and branched-chain amino acids in renal cortex compared to vehicle-treated db/+ mice. In contrast, glycine, sarcosine, and alanine were decreased. Conversely, 8 out of 11 biochemicals associated with the glycolysis pathway, including glucose, glucose-6-phosphate, and glucose-1-phosphate, were reduced in the renal cortex of vehicle-treated db/db mice compared to db/+ mice. Furthermore, carnitines, lysolipids, cholesterol, and the steroid hormone corticosterone were increased in vehicle-treated db/db mice compared to db/+ control mice. Treatment with formoterol restored amino acid profiles and corrected glycolytic and glycogen pathways, indicating an improved metabolic balance. Formoterol treatment normalized lipid and steroid levels and mitigated markers of lipid dysregulation. These data provide insights into the early metabolic alterations in hyperglycemia and mitochondrial dysfunction in the renal cortex. Importantly, this work demonstrates that formoterol treatment reverses many of these early metabolic signatures, further supporting its use as a therapeutic for DKD. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study identifies metabolic alterations in the kidneys of diabetic mice and is the first to evaluate the effect of the β2-adrenoceptor agonist formoterol on metabolism in the kidney. The study results showed that formoterol restores amino acid, carbohydrate, and nucleotide metabolism in a mouse model of diabetic kidney disease.</p>

<h2 id="article-53">53. Patient satisfaction and experience for virtual consultation services in the Malaysian government health clinics: A review.</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: The Medical journal of Malaysia

<h3 id="摘要-52">摘要</h3>
<p>Virtual consultation (VC) has emerged as a vital mode of healthcare delivery, particularly accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Ministry of Health (MOH) has progressively implemented VC services across government health clinics in Malaysia, guided by national digital health strategies. As VC becomes integral to primary care, evaluating patient satisfaction and experience becomes essential to ensure service quality. Despite the global availability of various tools, a lack of validated instruments remains in the context of Malaysian primary care, particularly in Malay. This narrative review aims to identify existing instruments used to assess patient satisfaction and experience with VC, evaluate their relevance and psychometric robustness, and highlight gaps in measurement, particularly for public primary care in Malaysia.
A systematic search was conducted using PubMed, employing a comprehensive search strategy combining MeSH terms and text words related to “patient satisfaction,” “patient experience,” “surveys and questionnaires,” and “telemedicine.” The search was restricted to English-language publications involving adult populations and returned 876 articles. After applying the free full-text filter, 397 articles were screened. Title and abstract screening yielded 83 potentially eligible studies, from which only eight were found to involve original development or adaptation of relevant instruments and were included for further analysis.
Among the seven included studies, most questionnaires were focused primarily on domains related to usability and acceptability, such as interface ease, access, and convenience. However, few instruments addressed core components of clinical care quality, including communication, diagnostic confidence, care continuity, and coordination. Furthermore, none of the reviewed questionnaires underwent complete validation and reliability assessment within the context of Malaysian primary care. Four studies were conducted in Malaysia; however, these either lacked robust validation processes or focused solely on acceptability. Additionally, no tools were validated in Malay or tailored specifically to the cultural and healthcare delivery context of Malaysia’s government clinics.
The findings reveal a significant methodological gap in assessing patient satisfaction and experience with VC in Malaysian primary care. Existing tools largely derive from models focused on technology usability or service acceptability, with limited attention to the clinical dimensions of virtual care. Instruments such as the Telemedicine Satisfaction Questionnaire (TSQ), the Telemedicine Usability Survey (TUS) and the Service User Technology Acceptability Questionnaire (SUTAQ) offer partial frameworks but lack comprehensive validation or contextual adaptation. In Malaysia, while efforts have been made to develop VC-related surveys, these are insufficiently validated and often lack specificity for primary care. Moreover, tools currently in use do not capture the broader service quality domains emphasised by frameworks like SERVQUAL or Picker’s Patient Experience Principles. As VC services expand in Malaysian public healthcare, there is an urgent need to develop and validate culturally appropriate, linguistically accessible, and psychometrically sound questionnaires to assess patient satisfaction and experience. These instruments must integrate both technological usability and the core clinical components of healthcare delivery. Such efforts are essential to guide quality improvement and ensure that VC services align with patients’ needs and expectations in the primary care setting.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-53">摘要</h3>
<p>Understanding the challenges of telehealth interventions is essential to determining their future direction in cancer pain management, as these are considered complex interventions. This systematic review aimed to identify the challenges associated with telehealthbased interventions in cancer pain management.
The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. A systematic search was conducted from January 19 to February 2, 2022, covering the past 10 years. Databases searched included PubMed and EBSCO. Inclusion criteria were articles published in English focusing on cancer pain in patients with any cancer diagnosis. Data were extracted on participants, interventions, and outcomes, with a particular focus on challenges reported in each study. A total of 320 publications were retrieved and screened; 38 articles met the inclusion criteria.
The most reported challenge was limited or slow Internet access, followed by lack of technological expertise among healthcare teams and low computer literacy. Human resource-related challenges were also frequently reported, including inadequate reimbursement mechanisms, concerns over malpractice, increased staff workload, and absence of formal organisational structures. In studies conducted after the COVID-19 pandemic, data-related issues such as data security and management were also highlighted.
Telehealth is a rapidly growing technology with the potential to transform healthcare delivery. Addressing the challenges identified in this review may help guide the development and implementation of more effective telehealth interventions in cancer pain management.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-54">摘要</h3>
<p>Congenital anomalies (CAs) account for approximately 8 to 15% of perinatal deaths and 13 to 16% of neonatal deaths. Congenital anomalies are a significant public health issue in Indonesia, affecting approximately 59.3 per 1,000 live births. The three most frequent malformations were hydrocephalus (21%), cleft lip and cleft palate (9.2%) and Down Syndrome (9.2%).
A retrospective case-control study was conducted at Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital, Jakarta, between September 2023 and October 2024. Data from 552 births were analysed, including 97 cases of congenital anomalies (CAs). Maternal, fetal, and environmental factors were assessed using medical records and documented clinical histories. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, cross-tabulations, binary logistic regression, and multivariable logistic regression.
The prevalence of CAs was 17.6%. Significant maternal risk factors included a history of congenital anomalies (OR = 3.7, 95% CI: 0.88-16.00) and severe anemia (OR = 4.37, 95% CI: 2.48-7.69). Environmental risks, such as drug use in the first trimester (OR = 3.43, 95% CI: 2.01-5.86), passive smoking (OR = 4.10, 95% CI: 1.89-8.90), and pesticide exposure (OR = 3.92, 95% CI: 1.26-12.17), were also significant. Folic acid supplementation showed a significant protective effect against congenital anomalies (OR = 0.56, p = 0.001), although the usage rate remained low (35.5%).
This study found a significant association between congenital anomalies and risk factors such as passive smoking, exposure to pesticides, and chemicals. It highlights the importance of ongoing community health education to prevent and manage these predisposing risk factors.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-55">摘要</h3>
<p>Job satisfaction among physicians involved in public health services including public health physicians and primary care physicians is critical for their performance, motivation, and retention. These professionals address systemic health challenges and ensure effective health promotion at the population level. Despite their significance, they face challenges such as high workloads, administrative burdens, and insufficient resources, adversely affecting their satisfaction. This systematic review aims to examine the levels and determinants of job satisfaction among physicians engaged in public health roles.
This review followed PRISMA guidelines and was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024613843). Articles were retrieved from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Fourteen eligible studies were selected based on strict criteria. Data synthesis employed an emerging clusters approach to identify factors influencing job satisfaction, categorised into four themes: job characteristics and role clarity, organisational support and leadership, work environment and culture, and rewards and career development.
Data from 7313 physicians highlighted high workloads (60%) and administrative burdens (53%) as key sources of dissatisfaction. Approximately 44.7% reported high satisfaction, driven by autonomy in decision-making, supportive environments, doctor-patient relationships, and work-life balance. In contrast, 32% experienced moderate satisfaction, linked to manageable administrative tasks and fair remuneration. However, 20% reported low satisfaction, primarily due to excessive workloads, poor leadership support, financial insecurity, and limited career progression opportunities.
Job satisfaction among physicians in public health roles is moderate through a combination of high and low satisfaction factors. These professionals face demanding environments requiring them to balance administrative responsibilities, staff issues, community satisfaction, and resource allocations. Enhancing job satisfaction is essential for improving workforce morale and achieving effective public health outcomes. Implementing targeted interventions to address these challenges can foster long-term workforce stability and organisational success.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-56">摘要</h3>
<p>DNA methylation plays pivotal roles in regulating gene expression and the secondary metabolism in plants. Salvia miltiorrhiza and Salvia bowleyana are traditional Chinese medicinal plants with roots enriched with tanshinone components. However, the regulatory mechanism of DNA methylation on tanshinone production remains elusive. Here, we analyzed 30-day-old hairy roots of S. miltiorrhiza and S. bowleyana using targeted high-performance liquid chromatography analysis and found significantly higher tanshinone content in S. miltiorrhiza. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing revealed elevated DNA methylation levels in S. miltiorrhiza, potentially due to the upregulation of methylation-related genes, including DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 (DRM1), DECREASE IN DNA METHYLATION 1 (DDM1), CHROMOMETHYLASE 2 (CMT1), and CHROMOMETHYLASE 3 (CMT3), alongside the low expression of the demethylase gene REPRESSOR OF SILENCING 1 (ROS1) in S. miltiorrhiza. Additionally, four genes that are involved in tanshinone biosynthesis, including 1-DEOXY-D-XYLULOSE-5-PHOSPHATE REDUCTASE (DXS1), GERANYLGERANYL DIPHOSPHATE SYNTHASE (GGPPS2), 4-HYDROXY-3-METHYLBUT-2-ENYL PYROPHOSPHATE REDUCTASE (HDR2), and COPALYL PYROPHOSPHATE SYNTHASE (CPS3), showed lower methylation levels in the promoters of DXS1, GGPPS2, and CPS3 and a higher DNA methylation level in the gene body of HDR2 in S. miltiorrhiza, which may lead to their high expression and the accumulation of tanshinones. Consistently, overexpression of the SmCMT3 in S. miltiorrhiza significantly reduced the contents of cryptotanshinone, tanshinone I, and tanshinone IIA. Transcriptomic and methylome analyses confirmed that the expression levels of the tanshinone biosynthesis-related genes, including SmMK, SmCPS1, SmDXS2, and SmAACT1, were correlated with their promoter or gene body DNA methylation levels. Our findings reveal that DNA methylation critically regulates tanshinone biosynthesis in S. miltiorrhiza and S. bowleyana, offering valuable insights for breeding.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-57">摘要</h3>
<p>Mendelian randomization (MR) serves as a valuable tool for investigating causal relationships between exposures and disease outcomes in observational studies. However, MR methods, operating under classical assumptions, may yield biased estimates and inflated false-positive causal relationships when faced with realistic and complex correlated horizontal pleiotropy (CHP). While numerous MR methods have emerged to address CHP effects, limited methods can effectively handle relatively large direct effects, commonly known as idiosyncratic pleiotropy.
To address this gap, we propose an efficient and robust MR method to account for idiosyncratic and correlated pleiotropy, named RMR-ICP. Furthermore, Our method incorporates linkage disequilibrium structure using paralleled Gibbs sampling to enhance statistical power. The robustness and efficiency of our method are demonstrated through extensive simulation studies and applications. RMR-ICP is first used to analyze the effects of plasma proteins on stroke, followed by its application to conventional stroke risk factors. Our analysis reveals that Selectin E (SELE) exhibits a positive causal effect on the occurrence of any stroke. Only those specifically designed to account for idiosyncratic and CHP identified a significant positive causal effect of myeloperoxidase on ischemic stroke, with RMR-ICP providing stronger statistical evidence. Elevated Natriuretic Peptide B (BNP) levels specifically increase the risk of cardioembolic stroke (CES), though not with other stroke subtypes. This finding is consistent with previous studies suggesting that plasma BNP levels may help distinguish CES from other stroke types. Higher Waist-hip ratio (WHR) levels raise the risk across all stroke types. These findings provide new insights into identifying stroke-related risk factors.

<h3 id="摘要-58">摘要</h3>
<p>Analysis of multiple types of omics data facilitates a comprehensive revelation of molecular-level complexity and interactions among genomic features. This knowledge promotes the development of new therapies for treating different genomic diseases. An integrative study of multiple types of genomic data instead of a single type of genomic data will be more informative in understanding the complicated molecular activities and their interactions. In this work, we integrated RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), methylation, and DNA copy number variation data, downloaded from the TCGA public repository, of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), reduced the dimension of these high-dimensional genomic data using an autoencoder, a deep learning-based method, and then used Cox-PH model to select the autoencoder-transformed features that have a significant contribution to patient survival. We utilized the significant set of autoencoder-transformed features to classify the survival subtypes using the integrated data. We built a classification model with a penalization technique, sparse group LASSO, and evaluated the approach using cross-validation. As a result, two survival subgroups, with overall different survival profiles and linking to various genomic features, are discovered for respective GBM patients. Finally, the results are interpreted biologically by differential expression analysis and pathway analysis.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-59">摘要</h3>
<p>In patients with chronic fibrosing interstitial lung disease (ILD), some may develop a progressive fibrosing (PF) phenotype, which presents as rapid progression and often results in poor clinical outcomes.
The objective of this study was to construct and test a model to identify independent predictors of mortality in PF-ILD and to trace the lung function trajectory of patients with PF-ILD.
This multicenter retrospective cohort study enrolled patients with PF-ILD from two distinct centers with 8-year follow-up to develop and validate a prognostic nomogram based on clinical factors and assess longitudinal lung function trajectories.
We enrolled patients diagnosed with PF-ILD from China-Japan Friendship Hospital (training cohort) and Jiulongpo Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine (validation cohort). Survival status was recorded during the 8-year follow-up period. Clinical demographics, laboratory data, pulmonary function test (PFT) results, and high-resolution computed tomography results were collected for analysis. A training cohort of patients with PF-ILD was used to identify predictors of mortality, which were then validated in an external cohort. A nomogram was established based on multivariate factors. The predictive performance of the model was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves and calibration curves. Survival estimates were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. The PFT trajectory was estimated using a linear mixed model.
A total of 1419 patients with PF-ILD from China-Japan Friendship Hospital (training cohort) and 282 patients with PF-ILD from Jiulongpo Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine (validation cohort) were enrolled. During the 8-year follow-up, 150 (10.57%) patients received lung transplantation, while 43.55% (n = 618) of cases reached mortality, with a median survival time of 53 months in the BJ cohort. A predictive model was built based on ILD subgroups, baseline Forced Vital Capacity%pred (FVC%pred), baseline Diffusing Capacity of the Lung for Carbon Monoxide%pred (DLCO%pred), age at diagnosis, antifibrosis treatment, gastroesophageal reflux complication, C-Reactive Protein levels, and BMI. We also found AEs and progressive declines in FVC and DLCO, particularly after the third year post-diagnosis, were strongly associated with poor prognosis and may serve as important longitudinal biomarkers for risk stratification in PF-ILD.
A predictive model incorporating multiple factors effectively predicted 8-year survival in patients with PF-ILD. In addition to these baseline predictors, AEs and progressive declines in FVC and DLCO were strongly associated with poor prognosis and may serve as valuable longitudinal biomarkers for ongoing risk stratification.
A tool to help predict long-term survival in people with progressive lung scarring diseasesSome patients with chronic interstitial lung disease (ILD) develop a progressive form (PF-ILD) that worsens quickly and leads to poor outcomes. In this study, we followed over 1,700 PF-ILD patients from two hospitals for eight years to identify factors linked to survival.We created a model using information like lung function, age, treatments, and other health conditions to predict which patients had higher risk of death. We found that poor lung function at diagnosis, certain complications, and older age were linked to worse outcomes. In addition, patients who had acute exacerbations (AEs) or showed lung function decline after the third year had a higher risk of death.This model can help doctors monitor PF-ILD patients more closely and provide earlier intervention.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-60">摘要</h3>
<p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains one of the biggest health challenges facing the world, with approximately 39 million people reported to be living with the virus. Despite low prevalence rates in the Middle East and North Africa region, Jordan faces a growing trend of new infections driven by factors such as refugees, migration, and socioeconomic status. Premarital examination is a requirement for Jordanian couples to get married and would play a role in sexually transmitted disease (STD) awareness and prevention, including HIV.
The purpose of this research is to assess the impact of premarital examinations on HIV knowledge, attitudes, and stigma in ever-married women aged 15-49 in Jordan.
Cross-sectional design.
Data were retrieved from the most recent Jordan Population and Family Health Survey, a nationally representative survey of health dynamics. Premarital examinations and comprehensive HIV knowledge were assessed by survey modules covering history of premarital examination and tests performed and respondents’ understanding of HIV transmission and prevention. Participants were categorized based on their responses to five key statements about HIV/AIDS.
In this study, there were 14,689 respondents. The mean age (±SD) of the participants was 34.5 (±8.5) years. Most of them (92%) were currently married. More than half of the respondents underwent premarital medical checkups. However, discriminatory attitudes toward people living with HIV were high among respondents. Only 8.7% of the respondents showed adequate comprehensive HIV knowledge; their level of understanding regarding modes of transmission and misconceptions about prevention also varied. The adjusted model showed that there was no significant difference in HIV knowledge between those who had a premarital exam and those who had not. However, higher education levels were associated with better HIV knowledge.
The findings indicate that the level of HIV knowledge among Jordanian women is poor and was not associated with undergoing premarital examination and counseling. This suggests redesigning the mandatory premarital examination and counseling to have stronger STDs and HIV awareness and prevention components. This change may improve knowledge and encourage safer health behaviors, thus helping to combat stigma and misinformed views about HIV in Jordan.
HIV is one of the major worldwide health concerns; approximately 38 million citizens suffer from it worldwide. In the Middle East and North Africa, however, rates remain low. However, in Jordan, it has started increasing in relation to migration pressures, refugees, and economic pressure. To date, improving health awareness has been paramount to understand the knowledge that already exists about HIV and its main target, women. The present study examines the relationship between premarital health checkups and awareness about HIV/AIDS among currently married women aged 15–49 years in Jordan. Jordan has considerable premarital checkups, which might be a very important opportunity for making people aware about HIV and reducing their possible negative attitude toward those living with the virus. The data were gathered from the Jordan Population and Family Health Survey, which was representative of the country’s health data. In the survey, interviews were conducted with women regarding their knowledge of HIV and modes of transmission and prevention methods. Results A total of 14,689 women participated in this study; their mean age was 34.5 years. Most of the respondents had premarital checkups, though only a few showed appropriate knowledge of HIV. Surprisingly, the knowledge about HIV did not vary significantly between those with and those without premarital examination experiences. However, a higher level of education among women increased their knowledge about HIV. In fact, this paper postulates that this period of premarital checkups might be the opportune time to upgrade their knowledge about HIV, thus promoting safer health behavior which will alleviate negative attitudes toward HIV in Jordan.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-61">摘要</h3>
<p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is associated with the development of different psychiatric conditions, including eating disorders (EDs).
To investigate the salivary BDNF’s ability to act as a potential biomarker for detecting the risk of developing EDs among young females.
A cross-sectional study was carried out in Amman, Jordan, with a total of 216 nutrition students completing the Eating Attitudes Test-26 (EAT-26) to assess the risk of developing EDs, the Cohens’ Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10) to measure stress levels, and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF) to assess physical activity levels. Dietary intake was analyzed using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. A nested sample of 34 females from both extreme EDs was selected and tested for salivary BDNF levels.
The nested sample of 34 female nutrition students 22.00 (2.75) years old with body mass index (BMI) of 23.60 (3.35) kg/m2 were divided into two groups; 18 students were at lower risk, while 16 were at higher risk of developing EDs. The salivary BDNF levels did not differ significantly between the low-risk and high-risk groups (391.03 (128.17), 339.15 (102.52), and p = 0.347, respectively). BMI, PSS-10 score, and total metabolic equivalent (MET) were significantly different between the two groups. No associations were found between salivary BDNF levels and BMI, PSS-10 score, MET, or different food groups. The odds ratio for the risk of BDNF-related EDs was 1.07 (95% CI, 1.03-1.10) in the higher-risk group versus the lower-risk group.
BDNF is not a robust biomarker of risk for EDs. The changes in salivary BDNF levels could reflect individual ED eating patterns rather than indicating a direct causative role in the disorder’s development. According to our results, psychiatric consultation for ED detection remains the gold standard for diagnosis and treatment.</p>
