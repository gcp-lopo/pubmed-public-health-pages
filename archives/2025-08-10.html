<h3 id="摘要">摘要</h3>
<p>To describe the development and the methodology for validation of a new scale for postpartum anxiety for mothers of preterm infants, and a ‘Velcro’ sub-scale of the Postpartum Specific Anxiety Scale for use with mothers who have had infants admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.
We undertook three forms of iterative psychometric development: (1) Patient and public involvement and engagement discussions with key clinical, academic, and lay stakeholders to understand the needs for modifying the Postpartum Specific Anxiety Scale-Research Short Form for use in this population; (2) Expert panel ratings with clinical and academic stakeholders; and (3) Cognitive interviews with mothers to ensure items were relevant, comprehensive, and understandable. Planned studies must ensure the psychometric properties of these two new scales.
Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement discussions identified clear avenues for modification of the PSAS-RSF, but the need for an additional NICU-specific scale was clear. Experts rated the new items highly on their relevance. Cognitive interviews further ensured that items were well understood and that meaning was being interpreted in the intended manner. Only minor changes to the scales were implemented after each change.
This is the first study to describe the process of developing and the subsequent proposed validation of postpartum-specific tools for use with mothers of preterm infants and those with infants in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Clear avenues have been identified for the validation and implementation of both measures.</p>

<h2 id="article-2">2. Maternal Use of Antidepressants in Pregnancy and the Risk of Postpartum Hemorrhage: An Electronic Health Record-Based Cohort Study.</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: Human psychopharmacology

<h3 id="摘要-1">摘要</h3>
<p>Prior studies have raised concerns about postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) risk associated with selective serotonin and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs and SNRIs), although limitations include possible confounding by maternal indications. The current study examined the risk of PPH associated with prenatal S/NRIs accounting for diagnosed maternal depression during pregnancy.
The current study is a secondary analysis of data from a cohort of 2213 pregnancies (1997-2010) identified from a large electronic medical record-linkage system. Exposures were identified from electronic prescriptions records and resulted in three main groups: S/NRI-exposed pregnancies (S/NRI users), antidepressant-unexposed pregnancies (non-users), and S/NRI exposure in the year prior to (but not during) pregnancy (former users). Data used to identify PPH occurrences included obstetrician chart diagnoses, diagnosis codes, and recorded estimated blood loss (EBL). The risk of PPH by exposure group was estimated using unadjusted, minimally adjusted (maternal age at delivery, delivery year, parity, and maternal smoking), and depression-adjusted models (previous covariates and maternal depression). Supplemental analyses included an examination of PPH risk with prenatal bupropion monotherapy.
The study cohort consisted of 837 S/NRI users, 401 former users, and 786 non-users, as well as 114 bupropion users identified for additional analyses. The frequency of PPH was 11.6% in the overall cohort, and was 14.7% for S/NRI users, 10.2% for former users, and 8.7% for non-users. The risk of PPH was significantly higher for S/NRI users than non-users in unadjusted (OR 1.82 [95% CI 1.33, 2.49]), minimally adjusted (aOR 1.66 [1.19, 2.31]), and depression-adjusted models (aOR 1.46 [1.02, 2.10]). The risk of PPH was also higher for S/NRI former users than non-users in unadjusted models (OR 1.54 [1.05, 2.26]) but not minimally adjusted (aOR 1.42 [0.95, 2.11]) or depression-adjusted models (aOR 1.41 [0.95, 2.10]). No significant differences in PPH risk were observed between S/NRI users and former users, between bupropion users and non-users, or between S/NRI users and bupropion users.
Prenatal S/NRI exposure was associated with an increased risk of PPH after adjusting for maternal depression, although residual confounding and confounding by other factors (including unmeasured factors) may be possible, as the risk of PPH appeared to be similar between S/NRI users and former users. Best-practice PPH risk management strategies should be adhered to for depressed patients, especially those who require treatment with antidepressants during pregnancy.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-2">摘要</h3>
<p>Food safety has emerged as a major global concern due to the growing number of food contamination incidences. As a result, foodborne disease burdens continue to rise, adversely affecting the growing number of vulnerable populations. A major pathogen of concern worldwide is Campylobacter, primarily associated with raw foods of animal origin. The pathogen is responsible for causing human campylobacteriosis and other serious health symptoms that result in high case-fatality rates and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis compiled results of cross-sectional primary studies reporting the prevalence of Campylobacter spp. in foods. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis protocol, a total of 131 articles were included in the meta-analysis after screening and assessment. From the meta-analysis conducted at a 95% confidence interval, Campylobacter was highly prevalent in poultry products (51.9% [47.0-56.7]) and vegetable products (43.3% [17.9-68.7]), but least prevalent in ready-to-eat foods (5.50% [-0.31-11.3]). This systematic literature review and meta-analysis identified poultry product consumption as a primary risk factor for campylobacteriosis transmission. These findings underscore the need for effective risk management strategies across the poultry production value chain to mitigate this public health threat.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-3">摘要</h3>
<p>This study aimed to evaluate the electrical characteristics of the da Vinci system’s bipolar soft coagulation mode and to assess its feasibility for dividing incomplete pulmonary interlobar fissures during robot-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. The electrical properties of the bipolar soft coagulation mode were analyzed using an electrocautery analyzer. Additionally, safety was assessed through experiments on animal tissue with an infrared thermographic camera. Finally, a retrospective review of clinical cases was conducted to evaluate the use of bipolar soft coagulation forceps for dividing incomplete interlobar fissures in robot-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. Resistance-voltage curves exhibited a plateau phase across all settings, ranging approximately from 53 to 120 V. No carbonization was observed in animal tissue at temperatures below 100 °C. In 23 robot-assisted lung resections using bipolar soft coagulation forceps, the average number of stapler cartridges required for interlobar division was significantly lower compared to the stapler group. Perioperative outcomes were comparable between the two groups. Bipolar soft coagulation forceps are a feasible and safe alternative for dividing incomplete pulmonary interlobar fissures in robot-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, with the added benefit of reducing stapler usage.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-4">摘要</h3>
<p>This study describes an outbreak of type C botulism in domestic cats in central region of Brazil, two decades after the only previously reported natural case in the specie. Between August and October 2024, 21 cats presented with flaccid tetraparesis and were clinically evaluated. The course of the clinical signs varied from acute to subacute, with signs including hypotonia of all limbs, bladder and intestines, hypophonia, and flaccid paralysis of masticatory muscles. Eight cats died due to cardiorespiratory arrest. Necropsy and histopathological analyses revealed no significant macroscopic or microscopic lesions. Botulinum toxin type C was detected in five cats through standard mouse bioassay: in feces (n = 3), liver (n = 1), and intestinal contents (n = 1). Although the toxin was not found in the remaining animals, botulism was not excluded based on clinical and epidemiological findings, absence of spinal or other neurological lesions, and the exclusion of other infectious agents. All cats tested negative for FeLV, Coronavirus, Toxoplasma gondii, and Neospora caninum, and were also screened for intestinal parasites. Despite the strong epidemiological evidence, including common exposure to commercial diets, hunting behavior, and outdoor access, the source of intoxication was not identified. This study highlights a rare and severe outbreak of feline botulism and reinforces the importance of considering this diagnosis in similar clinical scenarios.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-5">摘要</h3>
<p>Vacuolization, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, somatic (VEXAS) syndrome is recently described, for which the diagnosis and management lack official guidelines.
To assess the diagnostic capabilities and disease management of VEXAS syndrome among physicians in the global context.
An electronic survey was sent to clinicians with expertise in VEXAS syndrome between January and February 2025 to gather real-life data on the management of VEXAS.
Seventy-four clinicians completed the survey from Europe (n = 51, 68.9%), North America (n = 9, 12.2%), Australasia (n = 6, 8.1%), Asia (n = 6, 8.1%), Africa (n = 1, 1.4%), and South America (n = 1, 1.4%), mostly being hematologists (n = 24, 32.4%) and rheumatologists (n = 24, 32.4%). Majority of the clinicians were managing between 1 and 4 (n = 40, 54.1%) and 5 and 9 patients (n = 17, 23%) with VEXAS syndrome, with regular clinic review, typically under 7-weekly intervals (n = 44, 59.5%). UBA1 mutation testing was available for 76% of physicians and next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the entire gene was most common (n = 24, 32.9%) with a turnaround time within 12 weeks. C-reactive protein (CRP) was selected by over half of the clinicians (n = 35, 55.4%) as a marker of disease relapse. Treatment with corticosteroids at 1 mg/kg (n = 48, 64.9%) was the most common initial dosing and upfront systemic immunomodulatory treatment was added by more than half of clinicians (n = 39, 52.7%). The most frequent treatments of choice (n = 66) were Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi) and IL-6 targeted monoclonal antibodies (both n = 21, 31.8%). Azacitidine was mostly used in patients with concomitant myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (69.9%). Only 29.6% indicated that allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) had been successfully completed in their department.
This is the first clinician survey on VEXAS syndrome, encompassing a global representation of multiple specialties on current disease management, highlighting several unmet needs (longitudinal follow-up, lack of on-label drugs, financial toxicity) actionable for future research. Keypoints • Globally, VEXAS syndrome is being increasingly recognized, and this survey demonstrates real-life physician practices. • The survey identified both hematologists and rheumatologists as the main care providers, amongst other specialties, identifying the need for a multidisciplinary approach in managing patients with VEXAS syndrome. • Diagnostic UBA1 testing was available for more than 75% clinicians with turnaround time &lt; 12 weeks and C-reactive protein was selected as a useful marker of disease relapse. • Treatment modalities were heterogeneous, identifying the need for consensus guidelines.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-6">摘要</h3>
<p>Cervical cancer (CC) was a significant gynecological malignancy. Brachytherapy (BT) has found extensive application in cervical cancer radiotherapy, attributed to its remarkable features of high-precision positioning and highly conformal dose distribution. However, the field lacks a comprehensive bibliometric analysis. This research provides a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of cervical cancer brachytherapy trends and key topics, projecting future research directions.
A search was executed within the Web of Science Core Collection for publications on cervical cancer brachytherapy until 2025/6/23. Analytical tools were utilized to conduct in-depth bibliometric and visual analyses of the relevant online publications. The analyses covered multiple aspects, including countries/regions, institutions, authors, journals, and keywords.
A total of 2924 articles were analyzed, showing an upward trend. The USA was the most productive country, with the Medical University of Vienna leading in publications. Brachytherapy had the highest number of publications. Tanderup K was the most prolific author, while Pötter R was the most frequently co-cited author. The latest high-frequency keywords included “cervical cancer,” “interstitial brachytherapy,” and “image-guided brachytherapy,” among others. Through keyword co-occurrence-based cluster analysis, 10 distinct clusters were generated, effectively highlighting the research hotspots and frontiers in cervical cancer brachytherapy.
With medical imaging informatics advancing, research on cervical cancer brachytherapy has become increasingly profound. Recently, areas such as image-guided-adaptive-brachytherapy, effective biological dose, and radionecrosis have attracted significant research attention. Future research is expected to focus on developing and enhancing artificial intelligence (AI) tools to optimize brachytherapy treatment planning, aiming to benefit a larger number of cervical cancer patients.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-8">摘要</h3>
<p>To assess the predictive value of quantitative parameters derived from conventional MRI for determining the pathological WHO/ISUP grade in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) before surgery, and to construct a nomogram based on these parameters.
This study analyzed ccRCC patients who underwent preoperative abdominal multi-sequence MRI, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, and nephrectomy at our hospital. Patients were pathologically classified into low-grade (WHO/ISUP 1/2) and high-grade (WHO/ISUP 3/4) groups. Information on clinical characteristics and quantitative MR parameters was collected. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to create a nomogram incorporating the quantitative MR parameters with statistical significance to preoperatively predict the pathological grade of ccRCC. The area under the curve (AUC) was used to assess the nomogram’s predictive performance.
Binary univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses identified maximum tumor diameter, ADC value, and corticomedullary enhancement as independent predictors of high-grade ccRCC. The quantitative MRI-based nomogram demonstrated high predictive performance, with an AUC of 0.936 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.901-0.972). What’s more, we found an ADC value of 1.47 × 10-3mm2/s and a corticomedullary enhancement value of 0.90 were determined to be the optimal cut-off values, yielding the highest Youden index for differentiating between low-grade and high-grade ccRCC. The calibration curve and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test revealed that the predicted probability of the quantitative-MR nomogram had a good fitness (χ2 = 12.542, p = 0.129).
The quantitative MR-based nomogram demonstrated excellent performance in the preoperative prediction of pathological WHO/ISUP grade in ccRCC.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-9">摘要</h3>
<p>Obesity, type 2 diabetes, and therapeutic weight loss are all associated with impaired bone quantity and microarchitecture. Glucagon-like peptide receptor analogs (GLP1RAs) have direct beneficial effects on bone microarchitecture, in preclinical settings. This study aimed to evaluate the net impact of GLP1RA on microarchitecture in overweight/obese type 2 diabetes individuals. It was an interventional, paired-sample cohort study with oral semaglutide in consecutive type 2 diabetes patients with overweight/obesity and metabolic-dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease. Oral semaglutide was initiated at 3 mg daily, with escalation to 14 mg at the end of 12 weeks. Bone turnover markers (P1NP, β-CTX) were estimated by electrochemiluminescence and body composition by DXA. Volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) and bone microarchitecture were assessed using HRpQCT (XtremeCT II, Scanco Medical). There were 36 patients (44% males) with a mean (± SD) age of 50.8 ± 10.1 years, mean BMI of 34.3 ± 6.2 kg/m2 and median duration of diabetes being 7 (IQR 2-13) years. At 52 weeks, there was an increase in tibial total vBMD (317.4 ± 47.4 vs. 331.6 ± 52.7 mg HA/cm3, p = 0.06) and cortical vBMD at both radius and tibia (trend towards significance). Trabecular vBMD and trabecular bone volume fraction at radius were also increased. Males showed significantly increased tibial total and cortical vBMD, and trabecular bone volume fraction, but there was no significant change in females. There were no significant differences in bone microarchitecture based on steatosis or fibrosis reduction. Oral semaglutide improves vBMD in overweight/obese type 2 diabetes, despite a significant reduction in body weight.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-11">摘要</h3>
<p>Malignant triton tumor (MTT) is a rare subset (5%) of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), classified as soft-tissue sarcomas. MTT is an orphan disease characterized by rhabdomyoblastic differentiation, therapeutic resistance, and a sinister prognosis. The neoplasms classically arise at the trunk, head and neck region, and extremities. In 50% of the cases, MTT is associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a relatively common autosomal dominant cancer-prone disorder of the central nervous system. Few cases of MTT in the gastrointestinal tract have been published, including esophagus, duodenum, and rectum. In this article, we present what we believe to be the first report of MTT in the common bile duct. A multidisciplinary approach was the key in establishing this particular diagnosis, and workup included endoscopic ultrasound, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, pathological staining, and genetic testing. Literature focusing on MTT remains scarce, and patients with MTT are often included with other subtypes in broader studies of MPNST. Therefore, our literature review covers MPNST and focusses on MTT where appropriate. It provides the current understanding of tumor epidemiology, genetics, and diagnostic workup, and discusses therapeutic challenges and future perspectives. Our case report underlines the value of cholangioscopy-guided biopsies, and honoring patient’s autonomy in end-of-life setting.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-12">摘要</h3>
<p>The Chinese visceral adiposity index (CVAI), a favorable surrogate index for assessing visceral fat distribution and function, has been proven to be associated with various conditions, including diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and strokes. Nevertheless, evidence on the association of CVAI with the risk of incident hypertension among older adults is limited.
This study aimed to explore the association between CVAI and the risk of incident hypertension among older adults.
Data were collected from the annual health examination dataset in Xinzheng, Henan Province from 2018 to 2023. A total of 10,353 participants aged ≥ 60 years were included. Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the association between CVAI and the risk of incident hypertension by using hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed to confirm the association’s robustness. Additionally, the restricted cubic spline (RCS) was used to fit the dose-response association between CVAI and the risk of incident hypertension.
During a median of 2.72 years of follow-up, hypertension developed in 6990 participants. In the fully-adjusted model, compared with participants in the tertile 1 of CVAI, the tertile 3 (HR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.19-1.34) of CVAI was associated with an increased risk of incident hypertension and per standard deviation (SD) increase was associated with a 12% (HR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.09-1.15) increased risk of incident hypertension. Similar significant associations were observed in subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Additionally, the RCS analysis showed a significant dose-response association of CVAI with the risk of incident hypertension (P overall &lt; 0.001 and P nonlinear = 0.238).
These results suggested a positive association between CVAI and the risk of incident hypertension among older adults.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-13">摘要</h3>
<p>Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) and sleep disorders increase the risk of falls in older adults; however, their combined impact remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the individual and combined effects of LSS and sleep disorders on fall risk in a community-dwelling older population.
We analysed cross-sectional data of 1,101 adults aged ≥ 65 years from the 2008 Locomotive Syndrome and Health Outcomes in Aizu Cohort Study. LSS and sleep disorders were assessed using self-administered questionnaires. The participants were classified into four groups: N/N (neither condition), L/N (LSS only), N/S (sleep disorder only), and L/S (both conditions). The study outcome was the fall history in the past year. Multivariable logistic regression with multiple imputations (m = 20) was conducted after adjusting for age, sex, overweight, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, depression, and physical activity. Sensitivity analyses were performed using alternative definitions of LSS and sleep disorder.
The fall rate was 21.3%. The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were 1.54 (95% confidence interval, 1.02-2.33) in L/N and 2.11 (1.05-4.26) in L/S, compared with N/N. N/S showed no significant association. Among men, both L/N (OR, 2.09) and L/S (OR, 2.41) were significantly associated with falls, whereas no associations were observed in women. The sensitivity analyses yielded consistent results.
LSS is associated with an increased risk of falls, and the coexistence of sleep disorders may further increase this risk, particularly in men. Fall prevention in patients with LSS should address both pain and sleep-related factors.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-14">摘要</h3>
<p>Studies have shown a connection between sleep disorders, mild cognitive impairment and dementia. In this context, the present systematic review aimed to determine in large studies whether sleep disturbances are modifiable risk factors for cognitive decline. Following the application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, this systematic review selected 15 studies, with large cohort of subjects included (more than 1000 participants), who were longitudinally observed. Studies predominantly used questionnaires and interviews to collect subjective data on sleep. Eleven studies were based on subjective measurements, one was based on the International Classification of Diseases - 9th Edition diagnosis codes, and three based on objective actigraphic measurements. No study used polysomnographic assessments for the evaluation of sleep disorders.The results of this systematic review showed that extreme sleep durations (either too short or too long), daytime sleepiness, circadian sleep-wake cycle disruption, and variation in sleep patterns are factors associated with an increased risk of developing cognitive decline and dementia. Actigraphy, as an objective instrument for monitoring the sleep-wake rhythm, provided further insights into the association between sleep problems and longitudinal cognitive decline. These findings emphasize the strong connection between sleep disturbances, circadian rhythm, and the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Sleep disorders may serve as an early indicator for cognitive decline, also considering that they may represent a modifiable risk factor for dementia. Therefore, recognition and treatment of sleep problems should be included in the prevention strategies against cognitive decline, opening up new opportunities for the prevention and treatment of cognitive impairment and AD.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-15">摘要</h3>
<p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality globally, with lung metastasis significantly impacting patient prognosis. Identifying predictors of lung metastasis is crucial for improving patient outcomes. This study utilizes data from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database, focusing on a cohort of 13,441 HCC patients. We examined various demographic and clinical factors, employing logistic regression and nomogram analysis to develop a predictive model for lung metastasis. The model’s effectiveness was validated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and calibration analyses. Key factors such as tumor grade, size, stage, and lymph node stage were identified as significant predictors of lung metastasis. The predictive model demonstrated high accuracy, with area under the ROC curve (AUC) values of 0.803 in the training set and 0.783 in the validation set. Calibration plots confirmed the model’s reliability in predicting lung metastasis. Our predictive model provides a robust tool for risk stratification and therapeutic planning in HCC patients, aiding clinical decision-making. This study highlights the potential of data-driven approaches in enhancing patient care and advancing HCC management.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-16">摘要</h3>
<p>Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common chronic and disabling disease with a high socioeconomic burden. The primary goal of treatment is improving health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and maintaining clinical control. The aim of this study was to assess clinical control in CRS patients more than 5 years after endoscopic endonasal surgery (EES).
In this observational cohort study, 123 patients with CRS were included and they completed the Endoscopic Endonasal Sinus and Skull Base Surgery Questionnaire and updated European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps (EPOS) criteria. Three clinical control groups were obtained according to the EPOS criteria and corresponding EES-Q and domain scores were analyzed. Univariate analyses were performed to identify variables significantly associated with outcome.
Symptoms of 25.2% of CRS patients were ‘controlled’, 26.8% were ‘partly controlled’ and 48.0% were ‘uncontrolled’ according to the EPOS criteria. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug - exacerbated respiratory disease, allergic rhinitis, revision surgery, smoking, asthma, and nasal polyps were all significantly associated with partly controlled or uncontrolled CRS. The physical domain played the most significant role in disease control, followed by the social and psychological domain.
According to the updated EPOS criteria, only 25% of patients had controlled CRS more than five years following EES. This emphasizes the importance of unravelling the factors that contribute to disease control to improve treatment. The multidimensional aspect should be taken into account as well as the patients’ perspective.

<h3 id="摘要-17">摘要</h3>
<p>Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are now a well-established class of medication for blood clot prevention and treatment. So far, literature evaluating real-world data on the drug-drug interactions (DDIs) between DOACs and other medications in patients with pulmonary embolism (PE) is limited. This study aims to investigate these interactions in patients with PE to address this and improve patient care.
In a retrospective study, patients’ medications were recorded upon hospital discharge and reviewed again 3 months later. A clinical decision support system (AiDKlinik® Release 3.5) was initially used to screen for DDIs and drug-related problems. Subsequently, medications were entered into Lexicomp®, a comprehensive drug interaction database, to gain detailed scientific explanations and references for the identified interactions and their mechanisms. Binary logistic random intercept models were used to identify potential risk factors of drug-anticoagulation interactions.
The 477 included PE patients had a median intake of five drugs. Drug-anticoagulation interactions depended strongly on the number of medications taken (P value &lt; 0.001). However, the association was non-linear, resulting in a saturation effect for a higher number of drugs. The odds ratio for having at least one drug-anticoagulation interaction was 0.40 (95% confidence interval 0.17-0.96; P value = 0.040) in patients with hypertension.
The potential for DDIs with DOACs represents a significant concern. By being aware of the most common interactions, risk factors and avoidance strategies, the safety and efficacy of therapy can be optimized.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-18">摘要</h3>
<p>Certain moral beliefs and/or values about what is good or harmful can cause nurses and other healthcare professionals to object to participating in some clinical actions. Such objections are also called conscientious objections. Invocation of a conscientious objection (CO) can produce complexities in patient care and health care delivery and must be mindfully evaluated for its soundness. In this manuscript, a recently developed framework, The Ethical Evaluation of a Nurse’s Conscientious Objection (EENCO), is applied to expose hidden elements and nuances in a proposed or actual CO by nurses or other healthcare professionals, thereby illuminating strategies that can lessen associated harms. The EENCO is utilized to explore two types of situations where a nurse makes a CO claim. Scenario 1 involves a nurse’s reluctance to follow provider medication orders intended to relieve pain and suffering at the end-of-life. In scenario 2, nurses object to a visitation policy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we provide a summary of the necessary elements of institutional policy to address claims of CO using the EENCO. Drawing on the EENCO, the two scenarios were analyzed for their ethical implications. This framework contributes to the exposure, scrutiny, and clarification of potentially unappreciated aspects of CO claims. Steps for developing institutional policy are identified. Application of the EENCO guides the analysis of the two scenarios. CO claims are explored more deeply, thereby revealing implications for those involved. Additionally, the EENCO provides guidance for the development of institutional CO policies.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-19">摘要</h3>
<p>The pharmaceutical industry significantly contributes to healthcare advancements and the global economy, generating approximately $50 billion annually. However, it also produces around 200,000 tons of pharmaceutical waste per year, including active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and chemical by-products, which pose serious environmental and health risks. India, a major pharmaceutical producer, exports 40% of the world’s generic drugs but struggles to manage an estimated 50,000 tons of pharmaceutical waste annually. Current waste management practices remain insufficient, with only 30% of pharmaceutical waste effectively treated in developing nations, leading to contamination, antibiotic resistance, and bioaccumulation. This study explores sustainable waste management strategies, emphasizing waste characterization and treatment. Advanced technologies such as advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) degrade up to 95% of pharmaceutical pollutants, supercritical fluid extraction achieves 98% API removal, and bio-electrochemical systems remove 85% of contaminants. Circular economy principles, including pharmaceutical waste valorization into raw materials, further enhance sustainability. India’s Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) policy in pharmaceutical hubs like Hyderabad and Gujarat reflects a commitment to waste reduction, though compliance remains below 60%. Lastly, this study highlights the link between waste management and UNSDGs, particularly SDGs 3, 6, 9, and 11-15. Ultimately, strengthening regulatory enforcement and adopting innovative waste treatment solutions can help mitigate environmental and health risks, ensuring a more sustainable pharmaceutical industry, especially in emerging economies like India.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-20">摘要</h3>
<p>This study aims to analyze the historical evolution of violence against women across all life stages in Brazil between 2013 and 2023. Using data from the Notifiable Diseases Information System and population projections from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, an ecological time-series study was conducted. Trends were assessed through Joinpoint regression, while future projections utilized the Prophet machine learning model. The Random Forest model identified the most impactful variables for prediction. The study reveals alarming trends, with a projected 95% increase in violence rates over the next decade. Variables such as firearm use and known perpetrators were highlighted as significant contributors. The results underscore the urgency of targeted public policies and predictive approaches to effectively combat gender-based violence. Limitations include underreporting and data gaps, emphasizing the need for improvements in data collection.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-21">摘要</h3>
<p>This study examines the challenges and opportunities of implementing gender-equitable substance use disorder (SUD) treatment models in Brazil by revisiting a public policy initiative carried out between 2004 and 2006. During this initiative, a structured model of care, the Women’s Drug Dependent Treatment Program (PROMUD), was replicated in two additional psychosocial care units in São Paulo. The study seeks to contribute to the visibility of a historically hidden population of women with SUD by comparing treatment retention across the three centers and identifying risk factors associated with dropout.
This observational, non-randomized post hoc analysis examined clinical data from 200 women who enrolled in PROMUD-based programs across three distinct psychosocial care centers-CAPS-AD Centro (DT), CAPS-AD Jardim Nélia (JN), and the original PROMUD site. All centers implemented the model concurrently using a standardized protocol. Treatment retention was defined as weeks between program admission and dropout (max follow-up: 104 weeks). Drop-out was defined as leaving treatment for reasons other than referral, improved discharge, administrative discharge, or death. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to estimate retention, and Cox proportional hazards models identified predictors of dropout.
200 women were included, PROMUD had a higher percentage of white, educated and employed participants. DT had the highest prevalence of unstable housing and prostitution history. PROMUD and JN showed comparable retention at 104 weeks (44.8% and 42.4%), whereas DT exhibited the lowest retention (17.3%). Age was a protective factor (HR = 0.94, p &lt; 0.001), substance of choice was not significantly associated with dropout.
Gender-specific care models can be effectively implemented in resource-limited, community-responsive care units, though their success depends on local population characteristics and territorial dynamics. Despite the time gap since the original project, the challenges remain similar or have intensified.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-22">摘要</h3>
<p>The evolving landscape of health and social care, marked by technological advancements, ethical complexities, heightened legal scrutiny, and increasing rates of legal cases adjudicated against nurses necessitates a robust exploration of the intersection and application of laws to nursing practice, that is, nursing jurisprudence. Despite this great need, there remains limited empirical research which explores nursing jurisprudence. Where available, existing studies seem fragmented rather than a coherent programme of research. To address these, this paper employs a narrative review approach to catalyse efforts by synthesising emerging domains of nursing jurisprudence research and highlighting strategies for further work. Based on existing literature, four emerging trends were unpacked: nursing practice and legal liability, legal-ethical intersections, policy analysis, and nursing, technology, and law. Strategies to support further work include institutional commitment, targeted investment in nursing jurisprudence research, horizontal and vertical collaboration, and interdisciplinary synergy.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-23">摘要</h3>
<p>On 30 September 2021, Viet Duc University Hospital in Northern Vietnam, reported a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Delta outbreak, leading to an 18-day lockdown and repeated testing of all on-site individuals. At this time, SARS-CoV-2 was not yet circulating at scale among the general public and COVID-19 vaccination status varied among staff, patients, and caregivers. We estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE), attack rates (ARs), and adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) to identify factors associated with infection among infection-naïve patients, caregivers, and staff using multivariable regression analysis. Among 630 at-risk individuals, there were 131 (21%) polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 cases including three deaths. The overall VE was 78% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 59-88; P &lt; .05). Hospital staff (aRR 0.20; 95% CI: 0.09-0.42) and people who were fully vaccinated (aRR 0.51; 95% CI: 0.28-0.95) had a significantly lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (P &lt; .05). Our analysis shows the importance of being fully vaccinated in reducing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospital settings.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-24">摘要</h3>
<p>The human rights challenges faced by Queer youth in out-of-home care (OOHC), such as foster and residential care, have largely been overlooked in child protection research, policy, and practice development. This systematic scoping review aims to identify and synthesize the existing international, English-language, empirical research documenting the human rights challenges experienced by Queer youth in OOHC systems. This review followed the Joanna Briggs Institute methodological guidance for scoping reviews. Seven electronic databases were searched to locate relevant articles, including Academic Search Premier, APA PsycInfo, CINAHL, MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Initially, 1,384 studies were identified, with 50 meeting the inclusion criteria for the review. Braun and Clarke’s reflexive thematic analysis was used to synthesize the data and identify key themes. The five core themes identified were as follows: (a) sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression (SOGIE)-based rejection and harm before entering OOHC, (b) SOGIE-based discrimination and harm in OOHC, (c) structural disadvantage and exclusion, (d) mental health and social well-being disparities, and (e) social and relational issues. There are considerable gaps in the published research documenting the human rights experiences of Queer youth in OOHC systems outside of the United States. Heterocisnormative child protection ideologies and systemic issues, including constraints limiting SOGIE data acquisition, work to oppress Queer youth in OOHC, diminishing the quality of their care experience. These structural and systemic issues are the catalysts for SOGIE-based discrimination and harm experienced by Queer youth in care.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-25">摘要</h3>
<p>This study aimed to evaluate the impact of early ophthalmic referral for premyopic preschoolers on myopic spherical equivalent (SE) shift after school entry; and to identify risk factors for nonadherence to follow-up care.
A population-based longitudinal study followed 742 premyopic preschoolers (-0.5 D &lt; SE ≤ +0.75 D) from a countywide screening in Yilan, Taiwan (2021-2022), into first or second grade in elementary school (2023). Cycloplegic autorefraction and caregiver questionnaires were collected at baseline and follow-up. Children screened in 2022 comprised the intervention cohort, while those screened in 2021 formed the comparison cohort. Multiple regression analyses assessed factors associated with myopic SE shift and nonadherence to follow-up care.
Amongst 742 premyopic children (mean [SD] age at follow-up, 7.2 [0.4] years; 57.8% boys), the overall SE progression was -0.19 (0.39) D/year and the incidence of myopia was 14.8 per 100 person-years. The intervention cohort had a slower myopic SE shift than the comparison cohort (-0.15 vs. -0.22 D/year; p = 0.009). Referral at baseline was independently associated with slower SE progression (β = 0.070; p = 0.03). Amongst those referred in the intervention cohort, 63.2% adhered to follow-up care. Nonadherence was associated with greater baseline hyperopia (adjusted OR, 3.77; 95% CI, 1.69-8.41) and rural residency (adjusted OR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.23-3.30).
Early ophthalmic referral reduced myopic progression, but follow-up adherence was suboptimal, especially in children with greater hyperopia or living in rural areas.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-27">摘要</h3>
<p>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: It is widely accepted that maternal genes and the in-utero environment can impact offspring’s health. While fathers have long been considered mere conduits of genetic information, emerging evidence suggests that the paternal preconception environment can also affect offspring’s health. This review delves into the biological mechanisms, beyond DNA inheritance, by which paternal preconception exogenous exposures can shape offspring outcomes, and factors that influence these mechanisms. We also discuss practical and methodological hurdles in epidemiological studies of male lineage inheritance.
A wide range of paternal exposures, from environmental pollutants to diet and lifestyle factors, have been linked with offspring’s health. Several biological mechanisms, including epigenetic modifications in sperm, alterations in seminal fluid microbiome, and changes in the chemical composition of semen, may mediate these effects. Currently, most data come from animal models. Human research is hindered by difficulties in establishing and maintaining cohorts, accurately assessing paternal exposures, untangling the complex interactions among epigenetic mechanisms, and defining relevant exposure windows. Fathers play a more significant role in shaping their children’s health than previously thought. By unraveling the complex mechanisms underlying paternal environmental and genetic influence, we can potentially unlock new opportunities for transgenerational disease prevention and health promotion. The knowledge gained can empower the design of precision environmental health interventions that benefit future generations.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-28">摘要</h3>
<p>Using an explanatory sequential mixed-methods approach, this study investigated the development of fundamental motor skills (FMS) in 219 Head Start preschoolers (Mage = 4.33, SD = 0.63; 56% girls; 53% Hispanic) and examined how family environments, including parental and sibling influences, shapes FMS. Children were assessed on 13 FMS (6 locomotor and 7 object control [ball] skills) using the Test of Gross Motor Development-3. Parents of children with the highest and lowest FMS scores were selected for follow-up interviews, and Welch’s t-tests, interviews, and children’s drawings were used to triangulate findings. Results indicated that 56% of children demonstrated high FMS, while 44% had low FMS. Three key themes emerged from the interviews: (a) parental and sibling physical activity habits shape children’s FMS development, (b) active parental involvement promotes FMS growth, and (c) resource-rich home environments provide essential opportunities for FMS mastery. Children with high FMS benefited from active, supportive family environments, where parents and siblings served as role models and facilitated diverse PA opportunities. In contrast, low FMS children often faced barriers, such as limited resources, time constraints, and lower prioritization of active play. These findings underscore the vital role of family environments in fostering early childhood FMS development among Head Start preschoolers.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-29">摘要</h3>
<p>Blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction is a well-established pathological phenotype of ischemic stroke, and targeting BBB integrity has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy. Danshen-Chuanxiong formula (DS-CX), an effective herbal combination against ischemic stroke, has demonstrated regulatory effects on the BBB at various stages of ischemic stroke. However, its specific BBB-protective components and underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Recent advances in multicellular self-assembled BBB spheroids have shown distinct advantages in disease modeling and drug discovery, offering a novel approach to address these questions. To simulate ischemic stroke-induced BBB dysfunction, we developed an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-induced BBB disruption model using multicellular spheroids. To identify the effective substances of DS-CX responsible for BBB protection, we conducted a multi-parametric evaluation to assess BBB permeability, tight junctions, cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, inflammatory markers, and apoptotic phenotypes using high-content imaging. Further immunofluorescence and transcription analyses were performed to elucidate the BBB-protective mechanisms of DS-CX and its active components. Similar to the overall effects of DS-CX on BBB protection, preliminary screening fortunately found that both protocatechuic acid, ferulic acid, and senkyunolide I significantly reduced OGD/R-induced leakage, and upregulated the protein and mRNA levels of ZO-1 and Claudin-5 in BBB spheroids. Further multi-phenotypic assessments manifested that DS-CX and its active compounds effectively improved cell survival, reduced ROS production, inhibited inflammation, and decreased apoptosis, compared to the damaged BBB spheroids without drug intervention. Molecular experiments showed that DS-CX and its active constituents not only rescued the abnormal protein levels of pivotal targets related to oxidative stress (HO-1), inflammation (MMP-9, TLR-4), and apoptosis (Caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2) in OGD/R-treated BBB spheroids, but also normalized the dysregulated mRNA levels of vWF, HO-1, MMP-9, TLR-4, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-18 caused by OGD/R stimulation. Collectively, the present work successfully identified protocatechuic acid, ferulic acid, and senkyunolide I as key BBB-protective components of DS-CX against ischemic stroke. These compounds likely exert their therapeutic effects through multi-target regulation of oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. Our findings provide a novel spheroid-based multi-parametric screening approach for discovering BBB-targeted therapies in ischemic stroke.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-30">摘要</h3>
<p>Nonlocal perception plays a crucial role in studying animal cognitive movement modeling. In this paper, the impact of nonlocal perception on pattern formation is analyzed, and it is applied to study the control of pine wilt disease. It turns out that perceptual movement can provide a theoretical scientific basis for the multi-point outbreaks and spatiotemporal aggregation of pine wilt disease. For the top-hat kernel, we concentrate on the joint effect of perception scale and delay on the stability, and find that Turing-Hopf bifurcation occurs due to their interaction. Besides, the patterns near the bifurcation points are simulated in detail by adopting parameters with actual biological meaning, which are selected by analyzing real data, and diverse complicated spatiotemporal patterns are obtained, such as peak alternating periodic patterns and spatiotemporal aggregation patterns. Finally, we demonstrate that the artificial release of the parasitic natural enemy of the pest can drive the populations to reach stability in the form of the steady state or periodic solutions. The obtained results not only well explain the transmission mechanism of pine wilt disease, but also contribute to the study of biological phenomena such as the formations of flocks and swarms.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-31">摘要</h3>
<p>This study aimed to analyze the prognostic and diagnostic value of Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) and solute carrier family 16 member 1 (SLC16A1) in low-grade gliomas (LGG).
Gene expression datasets for LGG were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA), and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. The prognostic value of LDHA and SLC16A1 in LGG was analyzed using the survival package. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn to evaluate the ability of the model to distinguish between patients with LGG and controls. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of single gene was utilized to explore the potential biological function of the two genes. The protein levels of LDHA and SLC16A1 were analyzed using the Human Protein Atlas database. LDHA and SLC16A1 expression was verified using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Finally, the effects of low SLC16A1 expression on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of LGG cells were investigated using CCK-8 and Transwell assays.
LDHA was downregulated, and SLC16A1 was upregulated in LGG tissues compared to normal tissues in TCGA dataset. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival and ROC curves revealed that these two genes have potential prognostic and diagnostic performances. LDHA positively correlated with SLC16A1 in TCGA and CGGA cohorts. GSEA demonstrated that LDHA is involved in the chemokine and NOD-like receptor signaling pathways, whereas SLC16A1 is involved in the JAK-STAT and NOD-like receptor signaling pathways. Immunohistochemical profiles of LDHA and SLC16A1 were consistent with their mRNA expression levels. SLC16A1 overexpression and downregulation of LDHA have been validated in glioma cell lines. Additionally, low SLC16A1 expression inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of glioma cells.
LDHA and SLC16A1 have potential prognostic and diagnostic values for LGG. Therefore, SLC16A1 may serve as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of LGG.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-32">摘要</h3>
<p>Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is systemic vasculitis affecting medium and large-sized arteries that can result in vision-threatening complications. Temporal artery biopsy (TAB) has long been considered the gold standard method for diagnosing GCA; however, Doppler ultrasound offers a non-invasive alternative.
This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of Doppler ultrasound in comparison to TAB for diagnosing patients with suspected GCA and to determine its impact on treatment decisions.
A retrospective study included 56 participants. They all received a Doppler ultrasound and underwent TAB. The accuracy of Doppler ultrasound was compared against TAB outcomes. The impact of ultrasound on determining the timing of steroid treatment and its correlation with biopsy findings was also evaluated.
Most participants (87%) reported having headaches,73% had vision problems, 60% showed symptoms of Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR). Optic nerve inflammation was observed in 71% of cases. Doppler ultrasound demonstrated a sensitivity rate of 70% and a specificity was 53% compared to TAB. Treatment with steroids was commenced for 90% of patients, with the decision often influenced by Doppler results. The timing of steroid treatment did not affect the TAB outcomes. The biopsy results confirmed GCA in 53% of cases, and around 82% of them were classified as active GCA.
While Doppler ultrasound offers a practical alternative, Temporal Artery Biopsy (TAB) is crucial for confirming the diagnosis. Early initiation of steroids guided by clinical and Doppler ultrasound findings is both safe and effective in preventing disease progression and does not impact the biopsy outcome.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-33">摘要</h3>
<p>This study aimed to assess long-term recovery from multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-c) 24 months after admission. This prospective longitudinal cohort study included 21 children diagnosed with MIS-c according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria and admitted to Children’s Clinical University Hospital in Riga. Outpatient follow-up consisted of repeated visits at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after the acute phase of MIS-c. In addition to the initial interview and physical examination, the patients were asked to perform functional tests (six-minute walking test (6-MWT) and orthostatic intolerance test (OIT)) and complete validated tools (Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire (CFQ-11) and Karolinska Sleep Questionnaire (KSQ)). The median age of the study group was 6 years (IQR, 5.0-10.0 years; range, 1-16 years). The KSQ showed that sleep quality, non-restorative sleep, and daytime sleepiness were more associated with the 1-3-month period than with long-term sequelae. At 1-3 months, all children exhibited physical and psychological fatigue (bi-modal score ≥ 4). By 6 months, no patient showed fatigue (bi-modal score &lt; 3). The OIT showed no signs of orthostatic intolerance, orthostatic hypotension, or POTS among patients. Heart rate and blood pressure changes were mild. The 6-MWT showed significant improvement in walking distance.
 Most improvements in sleep quality, reduction in fatigue, orthostatic compensation, and aerobic capacity occur within the first 6 months after acute MIS-c, with no long-term sequelae.
• Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-c) is a potentially life-threatening complication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. • Data on long-term outcomes of patients with MIS-c are scarce, providing very limited insights into children’s well-being after 12 months.
• Our two-year study indicated that for most patients, physical and psychological health improvements occurred within the first 6 months after acute MIS-c, without long-term consequences. • RDW/PLT may serve as a practical early marker of oxidative stress response in neonates, reinforcing the safety of phototherapy while raising questions for preterm care.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-34">摘要</h3>
<p>Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a common cause of nosocomial infections, posing substantial public health challenges. The current study employed a synthesized zingerone-potassium-doped ZnO (Zin-K-ZnO) nanoparticles (NPs) against the growth and biofilm formation by S. aureus. A real-time PCR was used for assessment of the expression of antibiotic resistance and virulence factor (mecA and spA, respectively) in S. aureus under treatment with the NPs compared to control. 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to determine the cytotoxicity of the NPs based on the survival percentage of HCT-116 cells cultured with NPs of the concentration obtained for MIC. Structure analyses revealed that the NPs exhibited an approximately spherical morphology, with an average diameter of 37 nm. Antibacterial activity assessment demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of S. aureus growth by the NPs. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Zin-K-ZnO NPs (9.5 mM) was significantly lower than the value for zingerone (56 mM). Furthermore, Zin-K-ZnO NPs at the concentration of 64-1024 mg/mL prevented S. aureus biofilm formation by 19.9-81.0 ± 4.7%, which was significantly more effective compared to zingerone. Additionally, the NPs led to a substantial decrease in the expression of spA and mecA genes in S. aureus. MTT result revealed that NPs with the concentration of 9.5 mM had low cytotoxicity (92% cell viability) on HCT-116 cells. The results highlighted the strong antibacterial properties exhibited by both zingerone and Zin-K-ZnO NPs against S. aureus growth and biofilm formation.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-35">摘要</h3>
<p>The potential complications of endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) remain a critical surgical consideration. This study aims to examine complication rates and identify trends in ESS-related complications.
The TriNetX network was queried for patients undergoing ESS between 2005 and 2024. Diagnosis and procedural codes identified patients with a new post-operative diagnosis relating to epistaxis, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, meningitis, and/or orbital injury. Complication rates were calculated. The relative risk for demographic differences in complication rates was assessed. Joinpoint regression analysis determined trends in complication rates.
A total of 127,333 patients undergoing ESS were included. There was a 0.28% CSF leak rate, 0.24% meningitis rate, 2.09% rate of orbital complications, and 2.27% rate of hemorrhage requiring intervention. Among orbital complications, 0.10% of patients experienced retrobulbar hematoma, 0.40% experienced an extraocular muscle injury, and 0.30% experienced post-operative blindness or low vision. The 30-day readmission rates were 1.47% and 1.62% of patients sought emergency department (ED) care within 30 days of surgery. There were small but significant changes in rates of meningitis (annual percent change [APC] = ‒3.42; 95% confidence interval [CI] ‒5.65, 1.13), hemorrhage requiring intervention (APC = 3.0; 95% CI 1.92-4.10), and 30-day ED visits (APC = 5.43; 95% CI 2.52, 8.43) over time. There were multiple differences in complication rates based on patient sex, age, and race/ethnicity (p &lt; 0.05) CONCLUSIONS: There are age-related and demographic differences in complication rates related to ESS. The majority of complication rates have remained stable over 20 years, with only meningitis rates decreasing while rates of hemorrhage requiring intervention and emergency room visits have increased.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-36">摘要</h3>
<p>Adults with beta-thalassemia major (BTM) and comorbidities may experience poorer quality of life (QoL), while healthy diet are suggested to improve chronic disease management and health outcomes. The purpose of this study was to explore how healthy diet can impact QoL among adults with BTM, and whether healthy diet can buffer the impact of comorbidities on QoL of this population.
Cross-sectional data of 317 adults (18 years old or older) with BTM in Vietnam was analysed. Healthy eating scores was measured by Healthy Eating Scores-5 scale. Four domains of QoL (physical health, psychological, social relationships, and environment) were assessed using the 26-item Quality of Life scale (WHOQOL-BREF). Multivariable linear regression was used to assess the association of interest and its moderation between healthy eating scores and comorbidity status (yes/no).
Individuals with BTM and comorbidity had significantly a lower QoL score in physical health and social relationships domain than those without comorbidity. This association was inversely moderated by healthy eating scores, specifically in physical health, psychological, and environment domain. As individuals had higher scores in healthy eating, the difference in QoL scores in the three domains above between individuals with and without comorbidities reduced.
Individuals with BTM and comorbidities have a poorer quality of life. However, encouraging a healthy diet could mitigate this risk. Healthcare system should include dietitians and family caregivers in chronic care management for patients with BTM.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-37">摘要</h3>
<p>Aquatic insect larvae in high mountain streams reflect natural changes in water chemistry, making them effective bioindicators of ecosystem health. Changes in element accumulation in the bodies of larvae from the functional feeding groups scrapers and predators were monitored over a 5-year period (2019-2023). We aimed to evaluate long-term and seasonal trends in the accumulation of selected elements and to assess whether these patterns were linked to hydrological conditions or reflected post-disturbance recovery. Element concentrations were measured using ED-XRF spectrometry. Principal component analysis was used to identify accumulation patterns and their relationships with water flow rate and total dissolved solids (TDS). In scrapers, principal component (PC) 1 indicated general element accumulation, which varied significantly by year and season. PC2 showed increased in iron, copper, zinc, and lead with decreased in phosphorus and sulphur, with significant seasonal variation. PC3 linked an increase in iron and barium with higher flows and reduced chlorine and TDS, showing notable variation across years and seasons. In predators, PC1 also represented general element accumulation but involved fewer elements than scrapers. PC2 showed increased chromium and copper with higher flows and lower TDS, and PC3 indicated increased sulphur with higher flow and decreased zinc. Unlike scrapers, predators did not exhibit significant interannual variation, though seasonal variations were evident. These findings suggest that scrapers are more responsive to long-term environmental changes, while seasonal accumulation patterns in both groups are influenced by stream flow, food availability, and physiological changes during ontogeny.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-38">摘要</h3>
<p>The raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) is a medium-sized omnivore native to Asia. Because they live close to human habitation, and therefore, there is likely bidirectional influence between raccoon dogs and humans, it is important to investigate their potential risks. Here, to identify potential risks of carriage of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and human pathogens by raccoon dogs, we investigated spatioseasonal patterns of fecal resistome (collection of antimicrobial resistance genes: ARGs), pathogenome (collection of virulence factor genes: VFGs), and microbiome (collection of bacterial species) of raccoon dogs inhabiting an urban forest area and a rural rice paddy area in Korea. Metagenomic sequencing revealed that the compositions of fecal resistome, pathogenome, and microbiome were all patterned by season, and we hypothesize that the observed patterns are due to seasonal changes in the diet of omnivorous raccoon dogs. Furthermore, although less pronounced than the seasonal differences, we also observed the geographical differences in the resistome, with aminoglycoside resistance genes being more prevalent in the rural area, which may reflect the geographical difference in selective pressures for AMR emergence, such as the use of manure that may contain antimicrobials in rice cultivation in agricultural areas. Additionally, our network analysis revealed that specific antimicrobial resistance genes were linked to specific bacterial pathogens, e.g., tetA-P to Clostridium. Overall, our study successfully revealed for the first time that not only the microbiome, but also the resistome and pathogenome of wild animals change spatioseasonally, and that the risk of AMR in bacterial pathogens laden by raccoon dogs is spatioseasonal.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-39">摘要</h3>
<p>This study explores the effect of nickel contamination on the nematode community and assesses whether the presence of olive plants mitigates its impact. Soil samples were collected from both olive-cultivated and bare plots across a gradient of nickel concentrations (40, 70, and 120 ppm) in a Mediterranean agroecosystem. The results indicate that, even at high nickel concentrations (120 ppm), the presence of olive plants promoted the nematode community, while lower concentrations (40 ppm) favored the proliferation of bacterivorous nematodes (i.e., Panagrolaimus). The genus Ditylenchus exhibited resilience and dominance regardless of plant presence, while Aphelenchus also showed high abundance. Furthermore, plant presence maintained significantly higher biodiversity at 120 ppm compared to the intermediate concentration (70 ppm) in plant-absent conditions. In bare soils at 120 ppm Ni, nematode populations were entirely absent, while olive-cultivated soils still supported diverse communities, indicating a strong plant-mediated buffering effect. Diversity profiles and functional indices (maturity, enrichment, and structure index) revealed that olive trees not only buffered the negative effects of nickel but also promoted a more functionally diverse and stable nematode community, shifting dominance from fungivores to bacterivores at lower Ni concentrations. Multivariate analyses further demonstrated that both deterministic (Ni toxicity) and stochastic (plant-driven microhabitat heterogeneity) processes shaped community assembly, with olive trees enhancing resilience under stress. These findings highlight the importance of integrating plant-mediated remediation strategies in managing heavy metal-polluted soils and support the use of soil nematode communities as sensitive bioindicators for soil health assessment under environmental stress.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-40">摘要</h3>
<p>Introduction: Ballet dancing is driven by goals of artistic performance that depend on aesthetic standards. These standards involve maintaining a slim and muscular physique. Therefore, dancers tend to adopt eating behaviors that may have long-term consequences for their health and performance. This study aims to explore ballet dancers’ perceptions of their dietary behaviors. Method: This study employed a qualitative approach, utilizing semi-structured interviews conducted via videoconference. Recruitment was carried out on social media in January 2023. Interviews were analyzed through reflexive thematic analysis. Each interview was coded using an inductive approach. Categories were grouped into sub-themes and themes. Participant citations were then translated. Results: Eleven interviews were conducted with professional ballerina dancers from various Operas in France and Monaco. Analysis generated three themes. Firstly, dancers must meet specific ballet standards instilled in them by both instructors and peers. Dance instructors were perceived as authority figures, and their words about their students’ physical appearance during puberty often carried stressful memories. Secondly, our participants discussed their relationship to food. To match the ideal ballerina’s appearance, dancers recounted adopting unhealthy eating behaviors. Thirdly, once in a ballet company, dancers recalled gaining maturity and knowledge, which helped them realize the consequences of these negative behaviors. They became more concerned about their health and adapted their diets. Individual characteristics, personal reactions to instructors’ demands, and the influence of significant others influenced their eating behaviors. Our participants voiced a desire for attitudes to change regarding ballet standards. They wished for more medical follow-up concerning physical and mental health. Conclusion: When it comes to diet, professional ballet dancers should be considered not just as artists, but also as elite athletes. Eating behaviors play a fundamental role in an athlete’s performance and well-being, as they help meet nutritional needs in the context of high athletic fueling demands.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-41">摘要</h3>
<p>This study aimed to quantify and compare the total and anatomical regions of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) deposition in the human respiratory tract during endurance moderate exercise (EndME), endurance interval exercise (EndIE), and resistance exercise (RTE). A mathematical modeling-based analysis on anatomical and physiological characteristics of the human respiratory tract was conducted. The Monte Carlo method was performed to randomly generate different values of minute ventilation (ranging from 95% CI upper and lower) for simulated training sessions of 60 minutes for EndME and RTE, and 20 minutes for EndIE. Minute ventilation rate ranged from higher-to-lower in EndIE, EndME and RTE, respectively (p &lt; 0.001). Compared to EndIE and RTE, during EndME there was greater lung deposition for all lung regions, except for the mouth and bronchial tree (p &lt; 0.001). Moreover, RTE presented less particles deposited in the respiratory tract (p &lt; 0.001). Alternatively, when time-correction was considered, EndIE had the greatest deposition per minute and RTE had the lowest (p &lt; 0.01). Based on our results, beyond the intensity and duration of the exercise, the characteristic of the task must be considered, since the RTE showed a lower amount of PM2.5 deposition.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-42">摘要</h3>
<p>The dual goals of digital transformation and carbon neutrality have driven the interest in high-performance functional materials and environmental sustainability associated with their applications. As a new type of natural material, nanocellulose (NC) has a unique nanomorphology, high crystallinity, excellent mechanical properties, and a high specific surface area that enables the realization of fine nano/microscale structures. Therefore, NC is expected to replace traditional petrochemical sources in the production of various high-value-added functional materials, especially those that have applications in intelligent winter sports. Intelligent winter sports is the intelligent transformation and upgrading of winter sports by using modern information technology. Among them, the combination of artificial intelligence and functional materials has brought revolutionary changes in the field of winter sports health monitoring, monitoring, and sports performance improvement. However, to date, applications of NC in intelligent winter sports have not been extensively researched. Therefore, this report comprehensively summarizes the applications of NC in intelligent winter sports. First, the different forms of NC involved in applications in intelligent winter sports and the emerging strategies for the synthesis of functional materials are introduced. Second, the performance advantages of NC in intelligent winter sports are examined. Specifically, its practical and potential applications in human thermal management, detection of stimulants, action monitoring, and motion bioelectrical signal monitoring were considered. Finally, constructive views on the development of NC functional materials and their challenges and prospects in applications in intelligent winter sports are proposed.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-43">摘要</h3>
<p>The aim of our study is to highlight the inadequacy of focusing solely on occupational exposure in the diagnosis of lung diseases in coal miners. Other factors, especially environmental exposures, should also be considered. A 74-year-old patient with a 20-year history of coal mining and a complaint of coughing was referred with a preliminary diagnosis of coal worker’s pneumoconiosis due to abnormal findings on HRCT. Upon detailed questioning, it was learned that the patient had been keeping pet birds for 15 years. Physical examination, laboratory results, and pulmonary function tests were normal. A biopsy was performed due to the detection of an interstitial pattern in the lung imaging, and the diagnosis of fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonia was made. Although coal worker’s pneumoconiosis was initially considered due to the patient’s history of long-term coal mining, careful evaluation of all exposures may enable early diagnosis and treatment of accompanying or underlying diseases.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-45">摘要</h3>
<p>With climate change exacerbating occupational heat stress, objective and systematic exposure assessment is essential for epidemiological studies. We developed a job exposure matrix (JEM) to assign occupational heat stress exposure across Europe.
Aligned with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO: 7243, 8996 and 9920), the heat JEM provides region- and year-specific estimates of annual heat stress hours by job title, using the International Standard Classification of Occupations 1988 for Europe [ISCO-88(COM)]. Heat stress was defined as wet bulb globe temperature effective (WBGTeff) exceeding WBGT reference (WBGTref). Outdoor and indoor WBGT were determined using historical, region-specific hourly meteorological data (temperature, radiation, humidity, wind speed) across Europe, between 1970 and 2024. WBGT values were adjusted for job-specific clothing to obtain WBGTeff. WBGTref was based on metabolic rate, calculated using body surface area and job-specific physical activity, and adjusted for acclimatization status. Further adjustments were made for the job title-specific presence of local heat and cooling sources, time spent indoors versus outdoors, and working schedules.
The number of annual hours workers experience heat stress is highest among jobs involving local heat sources and physical demanding tasks, especially when work clothing is mandatory. Southern Europe has a higher annual heat stress burden compared to other regions. Exposure varies across calendar years and is substantially higher among unacclimatized versus acclimatized workers.
Incorporating job-, region-, and year-specific factors, the heat JEM provides a harmonized tool for studying occupational heat stress. Its transparent framework allows for updates with new data and extensions to other years and regions.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-46">摘要</h3>
<p>Occupational differences in COVID-19 are well documented, but the empirical evidence on potential reasons for these differences remains limited. Possible reasons include pre-existing health conditions. This study investigated occupational differences in COVID-19 disease severity and whether they can be attributed to pre-existing health conditions.
Our study used German health insurance data covering 3.17 million insured individuals (age 18-67 years), with details on COVID-19-related hospitalization and mortality in 2020 and 2021, information on occupation (regrouped into four classifications) and pre-existing health conditions (divided into seven disease groups). In addition to descriptive statistics, we estimated multivariable Cox regression models with varying sets of adjustments.
We found clear occupational differences in COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality, with the highest risks for the production sector (especially manufacturing), commercial services (especially cleaning) and for low-skilled occupations. These findings persisted after adjusting for age, sex, and region, and also after mutual adjustment for other occupational classifications. We also found some evidence that the association between occupation and disease severity was partly explained by pre-existing conditions, especially in the case of low skill levels.
Our findings provide support for occupational differences in COVID-19, where the occupational classifications under study were independently related to risk differences (eg, skill-level and job sector). Furthermore, we provide empirical evidence that differences by occupational skill levels are partly due to pre-existing conditions. This finding suggests that occupational inequalities in health increased during the pandemic, with those with poorer health who worked in disadvantaged occupations also being more likely to experience severe COVID-19 outcomes.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-47">摘要</h3>
<p>People with physical disabilities can use electronic assistive technologies in their homes to increase their independence. These technologies range from disability specific environmental controls systems to mainstream smart home technologies and combinations of both. The purpose of this study was to explore the perspectives of persons with physical disabilities on their experiences using these technologies in their homes to inform future best practice.
This qualitative descriptive study used a World Café method underpinned by appreciative inquiry. Nine participants with spinal cord injuries, cerebral palsy or acquired brain injury participated in four World Café discussions. Inductive thematic analysis was used to analyse verbatim transcriptions.
Five themes were identified: “Using Mainstream Technology”, “Navigating Person-Technology Fit Amidst Change”, “Making Technology Work in the Home”, “Positive Impacts of Technology”, and “Frustrations with Using Technology in the Home”. These themes supported expected benefits and challenges. In addition, the opportunities provided by mainstream technology in terms of availability and affordability, funding frustrations and poor trust of suppliers were described. Making technology work required support as well as technological safeguards.
Mainstream technology has improved and broadened possibilities for electronic assistive technology use in the home, which can be complex. It provides psychosocial benefits, but is also frustrating. Furthermore, using technology is a dynamic evolving journey as individual users must navigate changes in search of best person-technology fit. Successful use of technology requires support, as well as backup systems and safeguards to combat poor reliability.
Electronic assistive technology in the home includes disability specific devices and mainstream smart technology. Both support autonomy, psychosocial and physical health.Allied health professionals and prescribers need to be aware of the complexity of each person’s unique journey over time when they use electronic assistive technology in the home.Maximising the benefits of technology in the home requires navigating the frustrations of technology reliability, funding challenges, and finding trustworthy suppliers.A holistic integrated approach to recommending and prescribing electronic assistive technology in the home, must consider alternative backup solutions to safeguard the user.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-48">摘要</h3>
<p>This study aimed to examine the relationships among meaning and purpose in life, life satisfaction, and occupational burnout among forensic medicine specialists and autopsy technicians. Additionally, the impact of individual and professional variables, including autopsy frequency, on these psychosocial outcomes was investigated. The sample consisted of 298 participants, comprising forensic specialists and autopsy technicians. Data were collected using standardized instruments: the Meaning and Purpose in Life Scale (MPLS), the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), and the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, reliability testing, correlation and regression analyses, as well as t-tests and ANOVA. The results indicated that MPLS and SWLS had moderate reliability, while the MBI showed moderate internal consistency. A strong positive correlation was observed between meaning in life and life satisfaction. Conversely, both were significantly negatively correlated with burnout. Regression analyses revealed that higher MPLS and SWLS scores significantly predicted lower levels of burnout. Moreover, significant differences in MPLS, SWLS, and MBI scores were found based on education level, income, institution, professional role, years of experience, and autopsy workload. The findings suggest that meaning and purpose in life, along with life satisfaction, serve as protective factors against occupational burnout in forensic medicine professionals. High autopsy workload and recent involvement in autopsy procedures were associated with reduced psychological well-being. These results underscore the importance of institutional strategies to support the mental health and long-term sustainability of this vital workforce.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-49">摘要</h3>
<p>Migraine is common among women, particularly during their reproductive years. There is limited research on the use of antimigraine medication before and during pregnancy. This study was undertaken to describe the use of antimigraine medication 3 months before pregnancy and in the first trimester among women with migraine and to evaluate maternal characteristics associated with continued use in the first trimester.
In this cross-sectional study, we used patient-reported data from the Copenhagen Pregnancy Cohort from October 2013 to May 2019 and included all women with migraine before pregnancy. The use of antimigraine medication before pregnancy and during the first trimester was assessed descriptively.
Among women with migraine (N = 1586), 1241 of 1586 (78.2%) reported use of any antimigraine medication before pregnancy, and 347 of 1586 (21.8%) in the first trimester. Before pregnancy, paracetamol was the most used medication (793/1586, 50.0%), followed by ibuprofen (417/1586, 26.3%) and sumatriptan (191/1586, 12.0%). In the first trimester, paracetamol remained the most common medication (271/1586, 17.1%), followed by sumatriptan (49/1586, 3.1%), whereas the use of ibuprofen declined to 11 of 1586 (0.7%). A total of 278 of 1586 (17.5%) reported frequent use (daily or 1-2 times/week) of antimigraine medication before pregnancy, but only 79 of 1586 (5.0%) in the first trimester. Having a short length of education of 1-2 years, other chronic somatic diseases, or mental illness were, after adjustment for maternal age and parity, associated with frequent use of antimigraine medication in the first trimester compared to women with higher education, without other chronic somatic diseases, or without mental illness, respectively (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.93-4.95; aOR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.14-3.23; and aOR = 2.14, 95% CI = 1.05-4.38).
Most women with migraine used antimigraine medication before pregnancy, whereas usage decreased markedly in the first trimester. Only a few women had frequent use in the first trimester. Women with a short length of education of 1-2 years, additional chronic somatic diseases, or mental illness were more likely to report use of antimigraine medication. By offering an overview of patient-reported use of antimigraine medication before and during early pregnancy in a hospital-based setting, this study contributes to existing knowledge in the field and provides valuable insights for clinicians working with pregnant women affected by migraine.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-51">摘要</h3>
<p>Cellular senescence is a double-edged sword in cancer biology, functioning as both a tumor-suppressive mechanism and a driver of malignancy. Initially, senescence acts as a protective barrier by arresting the proliferation of damaged or oncogene-expressing cells via pathways such as oncogene-induced senescence and the DNA damage response. However, persistent senescence-associated secretory phenotype and metabolic reprogramming in senescent cells create a pro-inflammatory, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, fueling cancer progression, therapy resistance, and metastasis. This comprehensive review systematically examines the molecular mechanisms of senescence across diverse cancers, spanning digestive, reproductive, urinary, respiratory, nervous, hematologic, endocrine, and integumentary systems, and elucidates its context-dependent roles in tumor suppression and promotion. We highlight groundbreaking therapeutic innovations, including precision senolytics, senomorphics, and combinatorial strategies integrating immunotherapy, metabolic interventions, and epigenetic modulators. The review also addresses microenvironment remodeling and cutting-edge technologies for dissecting senescence heterogeneity, epigenetic clocks for biological age prediction, and microbiome engineering to modulate senescence. Despite their promise, challenges such as off-target effects, biomarker limitations, and cellular heterogeneity underscore the need for precision medicine approaches. Finally, we propose future directions to harness senescence as a dynamic therapeutic target, offering transformative potential for cancer treatment.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-54">摘要</h3>
<p>This study aimed to identify the factors associated with quality of life (QoL) in older individuals with chronic diseases, focusing on the impact of depression and functional independence in daily activities within a primary care setting.
A cross-sectional study was carried out with 200 participants aged ≥65 years who had at least one diagnosed chronic diseases. Data were collected using a sociodemographic form, the Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living, the Lawton and Brody Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale, the Geriatric Depression Scale, and the Brief Older People’s Quality of Life questionnaire. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify significant predictors of QoL.
The mean age of the participants was 72.92 ± 9.27 years. Depression (β = -0.669, P &lt; 0.001), independence in activities of daily living (β = 0.171, P = 0.013) and the presence of additional chronic diseases (β = 0.137, P = 0.005) significantly predicted QoL, accounting for 64.6% of the variance (adjusted R2 = 0.611).
Depression and reduced independence in activities of daily living are key determinants of diminished QoL in older adults with chronic diseases. Routine screening for depressive symptoms, and interventions that promote functional autonomy are strongly recommended in primary care to support QoL in this population.

<h3 id="摘要-55">摘要</h3>
<p>Executive functioning (EF) deficits are a well-documented complication of sickle cell disease (SCD), yet no standard intervention exists to address this issue. Adapting Daily Activity Performance Through Strategy Training (ADAPT) is a metacognitive strategy training protocol designed to enhance self-assessment and strategic problem-solving, showing potential to mitigate EF deficits in individuals with SCD.
Adolescents and young adults (AYA) aged 16-25 years with a documented SCD diagnosis were recruited. Baseline assessments of depression, self-awareness, and EF were conducted. Participants completed an adapted version of ADAPT, known as ADAPT-SCD, consisting of 10-14 sessions delivered either in person or via telehealth. Follow-up assessments were conducted immediately post-program and 6 months later. Feasibility was defined as 50% of approached AYA consenting and 10 participants completing at least 10 sessions. Acceptability was determined through participant responses in post-program interviews and surveys. A secondary aim was to examine the changes in EF and depression scores.
Feasibility of ADAPT-SCD was partially supported, with 38% (19/50) of approached AYA enrolling, and 10 participants completing the required 10 sessions. Acceptability was supported through positive participant feedback on post-program surveys and interviews. While most changes in EF and depression measures were not clinically significant, the List Sorting Working Memory subtest of the National Institutes of Health Toolbox-Cognitive Battery showed a significant improvement.
ADAPT-SCD demonstrated strong acceptability and partial feasibility. However, its impact on EF and depression outcomes warrants further investigation to establish clinical significance and inform future interventions for SCD-related cognitive challenges.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-56">摘要</h3>
<p>Kidney transplant recipients have an increased risk of side effects and complications and must adhere to a complex treatment regimen. Goal-setting interventions have the potential for improving behavioural, health and quality of life outcomes. The aim of the workshop was to identify the priorities of kidney transplant recipients regarding goal-setting domains, and to describe their perspectives on the design and implementation of goal-setting interventions.
We convened an online workshop co-designed with consumers and researchers with three breakout groups involving 18 adult kidney transplant recipients in Australia. Participants identified and voted for goal-setting domains (e.g., diet and nutrition), in order of priority, discussed reasons for their priorities, and provided suggestions for the design and implementation of a goal-setting program. Votes were then scored to reflect the level of priority assigned to each domain. Transcripts from the workshop were analysed thematically.
Of the seven goal-setting domains voted as important to patients, the top five domains were: treatment management (53 points), diet and nutrition (22 points), physical fitness (15 points), social participation (6 points) and mental health (5 points). Four themes that captured the discussions were: adapting to complex self-management responsibilities, strengthening motivation, ensuring safety and contributing to long-term benefits.
In a co-design process, kidney transplant recipients prioritised the goal-setting domains that addressed treatment, lifestyle and psychosocial wellbeing, and suggested that a goal-setting intervention should involve coaching and monitoring.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-57">摘要</h3>
<p>Impaired metabolic flexibility (MetFlex; the ability to regulate substrate oxidation) and sedentary behavior are both linked to cardiometabolic diseases, but the relationship between the two is not fully elucidated. This study investigated the effects of reduced sedentary time on MetFlex. Sixty-four sedentary adults with metabolic syndrome were randomized into intervention (INT, n = 33) and control (CON, n = 31) groups. INT aimed to reduce sedentary time by 1 h/day by increasing standing and non-exercise physical activity (PA) for 6 months, with continuous accelerometry. Substrate oxidation and MetFlex [ΔRER (respiratory exchange ratio)] from fasting to hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and low- to maximal-intensity exercise were assessed with indirect calorimetry. Intervention effects between INT and CON were analyzed with mixed models, and secondary analyses examined the effects based on accelerometer-derived behavior changes. INT reduced sedentary time by 41 min/day. Neither insulin- nor exercise-stimulated MetFlex changed in INT or CON, but carbohydrate oxidation during maximal exercise changed differently, favoring INT [INT +2.6 (95% CI: -6.1, 0.8), CON -1.4 (-2.1, 4.9) mg/kg/min; group <em> time p = 0.03]. In secondary analyses, those who successfully reduced sedentary time by at least 30 min/day (n = 34) improved insulin-stimulated MetFlex and low-intensity exercise fat oxidation compared to the continuously sedentary (n = 30) [ΔRER +0.03 (-0.01, 0.07) vs. -0.02 (-0.06, 0.03); and FATox +0.2 (-0.3, 0.7) vs. -0.4 (-1.0, 1.0) mg/kg/min, group </em> time p &lt; 0.05]. Changes in insulin-stimulated MetFlex correlated with changes in standing and insulin sensitivity. Thus, successfully reducing daily sitting by at least half an hour can improve MetFlex, with parallel insulin sensitivity enhancements, and aid in cardiometabolic disease prevention in risk populations.

<h3 id="摘要-58">摘要</h3>
<p>Message content may have unanticipated and harmful effects on population subgroups. This study assessed the impact of a weight-centric health message on body shame in college women by eating disorder status and college major (health versus non-health). Three hundred female university students (age = 20.1 ± 1.9, BMI = 23.4 ± 3.9 kg/m2, 78% White) were randomized to a 5-minute video communicating either a weight-centric health message or an intuitive eating message, then completed questionnaires to assess eating disorder risk and body shame. An ANOVA indicated a significant interaction between eating disorder risk and message type on body shame (F[1, 281] = 3.887, p = 0.05, partial eta2=0.014). There was a significant main effect for eating disorder risk status (F[1, 281] = 106.314, p &lt; 0.001, partial eta2=0.276). Among those with high eating disorder risk (35.6%), those who viewed the weight-centric health video had higher body shame compared to those who viewed the intuitive eating video (F[1, 281] = 4.708, p = 0.03, partial eta2=0.017). The interaction between major (health vs non-health) and message group was not significant. Future research should investigate whether modifying weight-centric messages to include intuitive eating principles may better promote physical and mental health for vulnerable subgroups like college-aged women.</p>
