<h2 id="article-1">1. Impact of administering cardiac medication to small-breed dogs with preclinical myxomatous mitral valve disease on survival after congestive heart failure onset.</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: The veterinary quarterly
<strong>发表日期</strong>: 2025-Dec

<h3 id="摘要">摘要</h3>
<p>Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) is the most common cardiovascular disease in small-breed dogs, and some affected dogs develop congestive heart failure (CHF). Although pimobendan is recommended to delay the onset of CHF, its effect on survival following CHF onset development remains unclear. This retrospective study evaluated the survival prognosis of 143 small-breed dogs diagnosed with first-time CHF due to MMVD, comparing pretreated (n = 54) and untreated (n = 89) groups. Pretreated dogs received cardiac medications including pimobendan for at least five weeks before CHF onset. Pretreated dogs had a significantly larger normalized left ventricular internal diameter (LVIDDN; p = 0.002) and higher left atrium-to-aortic root ratio (LA/Ao; p = 0.044) at CHF onset than untreated dogs. The median survival time after CHF onset was significantly longer in untreated dogs (481 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) 393-569 days) than in pretreated dogs (212 days, 95% CI 73-351 days; p = 0.028). Univariable Cox proportional hazards analysis identified pretreatment (p = 0.031), chordae tendineae rupture (p = 0.011), and the LA/Ao (p &lt; 0.001) as significant predictors of survival. Our findings suggest that the administration of cardiac medications, including pimobendan, prior to the onset of CHF was not independently associated with improved survival following CHF.</p>

<h2 id="article-2">2. Mapping utility and applicability of research and ethics frameworks for displaced populations.</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: Global public health

<h3 id="摘要-1">摘要</h3>
<p>Displaced communities face risks to quality of life and health, such as poverty, crowded living conditions, exposure to environmental contaminants, and poor access to healthcare, highlighting areas for research on the challenges they endure. However, these communities are routinely subject to extractive research practices with little regard to local participation or sustainability. To facilitate better research, there is a need for tools and frameworks that enable more effective, ethical and equitable research. In this paper, we synthesise and compare eleven research guidelines and frameworks addressing research conducted in displaced and vulnerable populations with the goal of assessing utility and applicability of frameworks for displaced populations. Overall, we found that the level of detail varied between documents, and that while many frameworks were based on expert discussion, few were co-created with community input. Additionally, the frameworks often failed to address nuances between different displaced populations in key aspects of ethics and research. Moreover, in practice, the frameworks were not widely utilised for research in settings of forced displacement. Based on our analyses, we identify recommendations to improve current and future frameworks, including adding context and community feedback, increasing flexibility and adaptability in research practices, and generating strategies to promote framework uptake.</p>

<h2 id="article-3">3. Blood Flow Simulation and Uncertainty Quantification in Extensive Microvascular Networks: Application to Brain Cortical Networks.</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: Microcirculation (New York, N.Y. : 1994)
<strong>发表日期</strong>: 2025-Oct

<h3 id="摘要-2">摘要</h3>
<p>Microvascular blood flow simulations enhance understanding of microcirculatory phenomena at the micrometer scale by capturing heterogeneity in blood flow. However, imaged areas often only partially represent tissue regions, leading to numerous vessels crossing boundaries and strongly influencing simulated blood flows through imposed boundary conditions.
Two key methodological aspects of blood flow simulations are addressed: selecting appropriate boundary conditions and quantifying the inevitable impact of boundary condition uncertainties on model simulations. An adaptive method for pressure boundary conditions is proposed and rigorously evaluated in extensive brain cortical microvascular networks. The adaptive method is integrated into a Bayesian calibration framework, inferring distributions over thousands of unknown pressure boundary conditions and providing uncertainty estimates for model simulations.
The adaptive method produces simulations consistent with reference data, yielding depth-dependent pressure drop profiles and layer-wise capillary blood flow profiles consistent with previous analysis. These hemodynamic phenomena generalize to biphasic blood flow simulation models incorporating in vivo viscosity formulations. Uncertainty quantification reveals a novel spatially heterogeneous and depth-dependent pattern in blood flow uncertainty.
The adaptive method for pressure boundary conditions will be useful in future applications of both forward and inverse blood flow simulations. Uncertainty quantification complements hemodynamic predictions with associated uncertainties.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-3">摘要</h3>
<p>Amid the high prevalence of Tuberculosis (TB) in Indonesia, Presidential Regulation No. 67 of 2021 introduces new hope by emphasizing a multi-sectoral and multi-stakeholder approach, highlighting the potential for greater involvement of village governments.
This article explores opportunities and challenges for strengthening the role of village governments in TB control through a review of relevant regulations.
A desk study approach was employed, using a policy analysis framework.
The regulation underscores the government’s commitment to combating TB through a comprehensive approach that engages various sectors and stakeholders, including governments at all levels, the private sector, academia, and civil society. A key aspect of the regulation is its emphasis on involving village governments in TB governance. To date, village governments have had limited involvement, with TB management largely remaining under the purview of health offices. The Presidential Regulation attempts to position village governments, as the closest administrative unit to communities, as an integral part of the TB elimination mission. In the Indonesian context, this is a breakthrough. However, regulatory analysis found that there is still a need to produce derivative regulations to realize the empowered roles of village governments and enable them to incorporate TB-responsive strategies into their development planning.
As such, the Presidential Regulation marks a significant step forward in enhancing the role of village governments in TB control; however, further regulatory support is necessary to realize its full potential.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-4">摘要</h3>
<p>Tobacco consumption remains a significant global public health challenge, causing over 8 million preventable deaths annually, with India bearing a substantial burden as second largest producer and consumer of tobacco products. Despite some advanced tobacco control policies, there are certain gaps, which requires effective implementation. To address these challenges, a national consultation was organized, bringing together experts to identify priorities in tobacco control in India and formulate an action plan.
A national consultation on ‘tobacco control priorities in India-challenges and way forward’ was organised where a total of 40 experts from the government, developmental organizations, and academia participated to formulate Short, Intermediate and Long-term priorities for tobacco control in India. Preceding the consultation, an extensive literature review and policy analysis were conducted to establish initial priorities. Subsequently, a consensus statement was developed to assist policymakers in identifying tobacco control priorities in India with agoal to achieve SDG 3a, aiming to strengthen the implementation of the WHO FCTC.
The proposed short-term priorities focused on promoting anti-tobacco curricula in health educational institutions, expanding cessation services, creating a national task force for Tobacco Control, training, monitoring and evaluation, and strengthening Tobacco Control Act. The intermediate priorities focused on advancing tobacco taxation, creating Tobacco-Free environments, adopting and implementing FCTC Article 5.3, building the capacity of National Tobacco Testing Laboratories and implementating Tobacco Vendor Licensing. The development of a comprehensive, multi-sectoral strategy to address the policy gaps and maintain resources to support the sustainability of tobacco control efforts to reach the goal of tobacco-free India were long-term priorities.
National policies and legislation play a crucial role in strengthening the comprehensive tobacco control framework. The collaborative formulation of short, intermediate, and long-term priorities for tobacco control in India is essential for their phased implementation toward achieving a Tobacco-Free Generation, emphasizing a holistic approach for addressing challenges and leading the way ahead.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-5">摘要</h3>
<p>TB Preventive Treatment (TPT) is considered as an effective intervention to reduce TB incidence by reducing the pool of TB infection in the community. This study was aimed to assess TPT outcome and its associations in West Bengal.
ology: A retrospective cohort study conducted using the data from Ni-kshay, the web-based TB information management portal of India. All TPT beneficiaries who have initiated with TPT in the year 2022 were included in the study. To find out the independent risk factor associated with unsuccessful outcome, risk ratio (RR) and adjusted risk ratio (aRR) has been calculated using regression models.
Median age and BMI of the participants were 32 years, &amp; 20.9 kg/m2 respectively. Median delay to TPT initiation from diagnosis of the index TB patients was 23 days. 90.5% (90.2-90.7) outcomes were successful while 9.5% (9.3-9.8) outcomes were unfavourable. 0-9yrs (aRR = 1.31), 10-19yrs (aRR = 1.16) &amp; 20-39yrs (aRR = 1.10) age-groups were more likely to be associated with unsuccessful TPT outcomes. Overweight (aRR = 1.10) &amp; Obese (aRR = 1.19) were associated with unsuccessful outcomes. Participants belong to urban areas (aRR = 1.37) &amp; attending Private Health Facility (aRR = 1.17) were more likely to be associated with an unsuccessful outcome. TPT initiation delay of 8-30 days (aRR = 2.03) and &gt;30 days (aRR = 2.90) was associated with unsuccessful TPT outcomes.
There are few gaps as well as few opportunities in the TPT programs in West Bengal. Gaps are both in policy level as well as implementation level. Identified gaps should be addressed for a better TB preventive strategy in West Bengal.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-6">摘要</h3>
<p>Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major public health challenge, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Operational Research (OR), supported by robust statistical methods, plays a critical role in optimizing TB control strategies.
This review highlights the statistical tools applied in TB Operational Research, their applications, and the emerging role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in strengthening data-driven decision-making.
We examine classical statistical approaches alongside predictive modeling, cost-effectiveness analysis, and AI-based frameworks. Case examples from diverse settings illustrate their practical impact.
Statistical methods underpin surveillance, diagnosis, treatment evaluation, and policy modeling in TB programs. AI-driven techniques, such as machine learning and deep learning, are expanding the analytical landscape by enhancing prediction, identifying high-risk populations, and enabling real-time program monitoring.
Statistical tools from traditional inference to AI-modeling are essential for advancing TB control. Strengthening methodological rigor, reporting standards and interdisciplinary collaboration will be pivotal in harnessing data for effective TB elimination strategies.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-8">摘要</h3>
<p>Silicosis, a progressive lung disease, caused by inhaling silica dust, poses a substantial health risk to workers in industries like mining, construction, and manufacturing. Development of new technological processes like jewellery manufacturing, processing of artificial stones etc has increased the number of cases with silicosis, especially in the female gender. Silicosis is incurable and leads to significant social and economic impact. Silicosis not only impairs the lung function but also raises the risk of several comorbidities, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, autoimmune disorders, and tuberculosis (TB). Silico-tuberculosis (Silico-TB), the overlap of TB in individuals with silicosis, is especially concerning as TB incidence is significantly higher among those with silica exposure, complicating both diagnosis and treatment. Advances in rapid molecular and culture-based diagnostics have improved TB detection in silicosis patients. TB treatment is done as per National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (NTEP) Guidelines and TB preventive treatment (TPT) given to silicotic patients after ruling out TB. However, comprehensive management and prevention of Silico-TB remains challenging. Efforts to combat silicosis must include both effective diagnostics and preventive measures. Raising awareness about occupational hazards in affected industries and within communities is essential to reduce exposure risks. Furthermore, exploring innovative therapeutic options is essential for improving Silico-TB management.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-9">摘要</h3>
<p>Medical imaging has been identified as a carbon hotspot in health care, and demand for imaging services is increasing. This study investigated switching off a surplus computerised tomography (CT) scanner when not clinically required as a possible simple and scalable intervention to reduce healthcare emissions.
This before-after quality improvement study introduced a ‘Switch it off’ intervention where radiography staff switched off the power to a surplus CT scanner after hours (17:00-08:00) for 7 days (‘intervention period’: 07/7/2023-13/07/2023). Using a power data logger, power consumption (kilowatt hours, KWh) during the intervention period was compared to 7 days without the switch-off practice (‘control period’: 24/07/2023-31/07/2023). Financial and carbon emission impacts were calculated based on energy consumption. All CT radiographers working in the department were invited to undertake a pre and post intervention survey. Differences in quantitative data pre- and postintervention were analysed using chi-squared test for independent proportions. Free text survey responses were summarised into themes.
Compared with energy use in the control period (433.96 kWh), there was a reduction in 139.79 kWh during the intervention period (294.17 kWh): 32% relative reduction. Extrapolation to 12 months found potential savings of 7280 kWh in energy use, $1381 to the hospital budget, and 5.5 T CO2e to the carbon budget. Of the 22 CT radiographers invited, 10 (45%) completed the survey, reporting no or trivial clinical impacts from switching off. The proportion of radiographers reporting switching off the scanner when not in use increased by 70% (95% CI: 39%, 100%; p = 0.002) from 10% (1/10) pre- to 80% (8/10) postintervention.
Identifying and switching off surplus CT scanners in low use times is a simple and scalable intervention that can achieve significant power, financial and carbon savings with little to no impact on clinical workflow.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-10">摘要</h3>
<p>This study evaluates the diagnostic contribution of Superb Microvascular Imaging (SMI), and Shear Wave Elastography (SWE) to TI-RADS in differentiating benign and malignant thyroid nodules.
This prospective study enrolled patients scheduled for thyroid fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). Grayscale ultrasound, SMI, and SWE of the nodules were performed before FNAB. TI-RADS categories, vascularity patterns, vascularity index, and elasticity indices were recorded. Diagnostic performance was analyzed using ROC curves, logistic regression, and the DeLong test.
A total of 478 thyroid nodules were analyzed, comprising 441 (92.2%) benign and 37 (7.7%) malignant cases (35 papillary and 2 medullary carcinomas). The mean age was significantly higher in the benign group (54.61 ± 11.54 years) compared to the malignant group (46.84 ± 15.38 years, p = 0.005). The most common vascularity type was type 3 (48.5% in benign and 81.1% in malignant). Malignancy rates were significantly higher in nodules with vascularity type 3 compared to type 2 (p &lt; 0.001). ROC analysis identified an optimal SWE cut-off value of 36.9 kPa (p &lt; 0.001), but the VI showed no significant difference (p = 0.662). The combined model consisting of TI-RADS score, SWE mean value, and vascularity distribution type demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy, with an AUC of 0.89.
Combination of TI-RADS, SMI, and SWE improves diagnostic accuracy in thyroid nodule assessment. Vascularity type 3 and SWE index value are strong, independent predictors of malignancy. The clinical applicability of these tools has the potential to reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies and to improve the management of patients.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-11">摘要</h3>
<p>We evaluated the association between the inflammatory potential of the maternal diet during pregnancy and levels of inflammatory biomarkers measured in cord blood and maternal serum at birth. Dietary inflammatory potential was calculated using the energy-adjusted dietary inflammatory index (E-DII) in the French EDEN and ELFE birth cohorts. Biomarkers of inflammation (interleukin [IL]-1β, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor α [TNF-α]) were measured from cord blood (EDEN [n = 758]; ELFE [n = 899]) and maternal serum (in ELFE only; [n = 911]) collected at birth. Additionally, leptin was also measured from cord blood in EDEN (n = 1202) and C-reactive protein was measured from cord blood in ELFE (n = 895). Linear regression models, adjusted for confounders, were used to investigate the association between tertiles of the E-DII score and each log-transformed biomarker. There were no significant associations between the E-DII score and maternal or cord blood biomarkers in either cohort. The energy-adjusted dietary inflammatory index score during pregnancy was not associated with concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers in either maternal serum or cord blood at birth.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-12">摘要</h3>
<p>Camptocormia is a frequent axial postural deformity in Parkinson’s disease (PD) that is prevalent in up to 18% in the PD population. Camptocormic PD patients have a lower quality of life and higher risks of falls, back pain and spondylarthrosis. Camptocormia is probably induced by brain changes caused by PD. Despite the myopathic changes in camptocormic PD patients’ spine muscles and camptocormia’s clinical similarity with dystonic postures, its pathophysiology seems to be different from myopathy and dystonia. The exact pathogenesis is however unclear. There is no consensus for treatment of PD-related camptocormia, although some nonpharmacological (e.g., backpack weight, back extensors and physiotherapy), pharmacological (e.g., levodopa, istradefylline and botulinum toxin) and surgical approaches (surgical corrections and deep brain stimulation) were elaborated upon with variable effects. There are still many gaps in data regarding clinical predictors, pathophysiology, the treatment and prevention of camptocormia. Multicenter studies (particularly on nonpharmacological therapy, on preventing strategies, and on favorizing factors) are needed. We identified an unexpectedly limited number of publications on camptocormia in PD. As of August 2025, the search strategy with MeSH terms related to camptocormia, on PubMed returned only 220 results. After screening, only 138 of the titles and abstracts were relevant to the topics. Of all these publications, only 27 (19.6%) were reviews, and more than half of which (15 reviews) focused on some characteristics of camptocormia (e.g., surgical treatment, deep brain stimulation, and prevalence or etiology) but did not elucidate on all its complex aspects. The present narrative review aims to describe different aspects of camptocormia ranging from its prevalence to the pathophysiology and treatment possibilities and provide a comprehensive image of this disorder.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-13">摘要</h3>
<p>Western health economic evaluation tools often fail to reflect the relational, collective, and holistic perspectives that underpin Indigenous concepts of health. These limitations pose challenges when applying Western measures in Indigenous contexts. The individualistic foundation of the Western definition of health and the values that inform it are significantly different from the community-based values typically found in Canadian Indigenous communities. For health economics to effectively support Indigenous health decision making, a values-based approach should initially be undertaken to identify conceptual commonalities with Western perspectives.
This study aimed to develop a conceptual framework that identifies shared elements between Western and First Nations understandings of health resource decision making, with the goal of supporting the creation of culturally meaningful health outcome measures.
Through a Health Economics Technical Advisory Group (HE-TAG) in Alberta, Canada, co-led by Indigenous and non-Indigenous researchers, we conducted a conceptual exploration of health resource decision making. Fourteen HE-TAG sessions held between July 2021 and June 2023 were transcribed and analyzed using a hybrid approach-combining Q methodology, thematic analysis (Braun &amp; Clarke), and Walker and Avant’s concept analysis.
Transcripts from 14 HE-TAG sessions provide the qualitative data upon which analysis was conducted. Sessions were held online using virtual meeting technology, and recordings were transcribed and analyzed.
Indigenous and Western conceptual frameworks allow for a common understanding of health resourcing. Indigenous community and culture and Western economic evaluation and social determinants of health were the four main observed themes, each of which contained two subthemes which differentiated between concepts of ‘health.’ Five concepts were found to resonate between Indigenous and Western themes when exploring health resource thinking: values, holism, time, resources, and context. Concepts and themes were mapped to illustrate common approaches to understanding health resource decision making.
This Indigenous-informed research aligns concepts of resource decision making by showing the thematic backgrounds of First Nations and Western thinking, which are linked by the common concepts of values, holism, time, resources, and context. Centering future community engagement on these shared concepts while grounding them in community-generated health value sets can advance the development of novel, culturally relevant health outcome measures.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-15">摘要</h3>
<p>Multisystemic Therapy for Child Abuse and Neglect (MST-CAN) has been shown to effectively reduce social worker-assessed child neglect and child problems. However, no research has examined the effects of MST-CAN on parenting behaviors or identified which intervention targets are associated with reductions in child problems. This study examined changes in child internalizing and externalizing problems, parental psychological control, neglectful parenting, and social worker-assessed neglect, accounting for therapist effects, and assessed how parenting and neglect predict child outcomes in 143 parent-child dyads in Switzerland (mean child age = 10.5 years, 54.1% boys). Multilevel regression showed significant reductions in social worker-assessed neglect (b = 14.10, SE = 3.49, p &lt; .001) and child problems (b = 4.97, SE = 0.88, p &lt; .001) with low intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC = .049, ICC = .017). Neglectful parenting (b = 0.03, SE = 0.05, p = .640) and psychological control (b = 0.10, SE = 0.07, p = .140) were not significantly reduced. Parenting and social worker assessed neglect did not affect changes in child problems. Findings demonstrate MST-CAN’s effectiveness in reducing social worker-assessed neglect and child problems but highlight the need for targeting psychological control and multi-method and multi-informant assessments of parenting behaviors.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-16">摘要</h3>
<p>Arsenic is widely found in nature, and because of its carcinogenic properties, it has come to be a serious threat to human health. The effects of arsenic on the human body are influenced by a variety of factors, including the level of arsenic in external environmental pollutants and individual human factors. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the level of arsenic in populations living in arsenic-contaminated areas and the influencing factors. Environmental media samples (water and wheat) and biological samples (hair) were selected for arsenic analysis in both arsenic-contaminated and arsenic-safe areas. Socio-demographic information and behavioral characteristics information were obtained from questionnaires to analyze factors that cause an increase in arsenic levels in the body. In study area, 89.33% of the water samples exceeded the national standard (10 μg/L) and 2.13% of the wheat samples had arsenic concentrations above the safe limit (0.5 mg/kg). In contrast, arsenic levels in drinking water and wheat in the control area were within safe limits. A presence of 29 (29.29%) respondents with levels of arsenic in hair higher than 1 mg/kg was found in arsenic-contaminated areas. The results of the analysis showed a significant difference (P &lt; 0.05) in the level of arsenic in the hair of the inhabitants of arsenic-contaminated areas and those of arsenic-safe areas, with concentrations of 0.967 mg/kg and 0.392 mg/kg, respectively. Univariate comparative analysis of factors affecting body arsenic levels showed correlations between sex, age, years of residence, smoking, disease history, wheat-based food intake, and levels of arsenic in hair. Multiple linear regression analysis identified gender, age, and wheat-based food intake as risk factors for increased arsenic levels. The study of factors influencing the level of arsenic in the body can provide a scientific basis for the precise prevention and control of health problems resulting from environmental pollution.</p>

<p>Workplace violence (WPV) in healthcare is a growing crisis, and hospital-based approaches are urgently needed. We review two recently published efforts and describe our own pathway to address WPV. Sahota et al. implemented a specialized team and leveraged individualized care plans for high-risk patients, while Littlefield et al. took a policy-driven approach, enabling administrative discharge of disruptive patients. Our pathway utilized patient-centered anticipatory guidance, staff de-escalation training, and a behavioral emergency response. All three approaches illustrate that WPV prevention must move beyond reactive protocols and pivot to proactive, patient-informed solutions.</p>

<p>Respiratory infectious diseases caused by viruses pose a serious threat to human and animal health. In the search for effective antiviral agents, natural polysaccharides have emerged as promising candidates with significant potential. As natural bioactive compounds with low toxicity, polysaccharides exert antirespiratory virus effects through multiple mechanisms, including regulating immune response, inhibiting virus replication, and preventing virus adsorption and invasion. These multifaceted properties endow natural polysaccharides with broad therapeutic prospects, warranting further investigation. This review comprehensively summarizes the current understanding of the antiviral effects of natural polysaccharides and their derivatives while illustrating their underlying mechanisms, thereby providing a scientific foundation for the development of novel antiviral drugs and the advancement of natural polysaccharide-based therapeutics.</p>

<p>Dengue is a significant public health concern in tropical countries. This study explored the short-term associations between monthly climatic variables and dengue incidence. Dengue cases and weather parameters from 2001 to 2023 were collected in Can Tho City, a central province of the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. A quasi-Poisson regression with a distributed lag linear model was employed to determine the associations. A total of 32 265 dengue cases were collected. Of these cases, 53.7% were male, and 64.1% were under 15. Each 5% increase in relative humidity was associated with a 19.3% increase in dengue cases. Each 1°C increase in average temperature was associated with a 13.8% increase in dengue cases. Rainfall showed a negative effect, with each 5 mm increase in rainfall decreasing cases by 1.3%. Wind velocity showed no significant impact. The study demonstrated that relative humidity and temperature are key predictors for dengue forecasting and prevention.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-20">摘要</h3>
<p>BACKGROUND Compartment syndrome is a serious condition characterized by increased interstitial pressure within a closed osseofascial compartment, which can result from decreased compartment volume, increased contents, or external pressures. Gluteal and thigh compartment syndrome, although rare, is linked to severe local complications such as tissue necrosis, infection, and even amputation, as well as systemic issues like renal failure and, in some cases, death. Prompt recognition and treatment are essential for improving outcomes, as delays significantly raise the risk of adverse and potentially life-threatening consequences. Acute gluteal compartment syndrome often results from prolonged pressure due to immobilization and can be associated with collapse caused by alcohol or drug abuse. CASE REPORT A 30-year-old male intravenous drug user (IVDU) was admitted with severe pain, swelling, and motor deficits in the right thigh and gluteal region due to prolonged immobilization during loss of consciousness from drug use. Examination revealed sciatic nerve palsy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed swelling of the gluteal and posterior thigh muscles along with fluid collection. Emergency fasciotomy and sciatic nerve release were performed through a posterior approach. Postoperatively, the patient experienced rapid improvement in neurological function and mobility. CONCLUSIONS Our findings underscore the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion among immobilized patients, especially intravenous drug users who may remain unconscious for extended periods, crushing parts of their bodies. Early recognition and intervention are vital for preventing severe complications associated with this condition. This case highlights the need for increased awareness and proactive management when treating IVDUs presenting with severe pain in the gluteal or thigh region and acute sciatic nerve palsy.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-21">摘要</h3>
<p>Pain, sleep disturbances, and substance use are common in adolescence, with research indicating that genetic and environmental factors account for variation in each of these behavioral and health outcomes. Moreover, pain, sleep disturbances, and substance use often co-occur during adolescence. However, research has not examined whether there is genetic and/or environmental covariation across these constructs in early adolescence or in diverse samples. To address these gaps, we examined genetic and environmental covariation in pain, sleep disturbances, and substance use intent in early adolescence.
Our study used data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) twin subsample at age 12/13 (834 monozygotic twins (MZ) and 1262 dizygotic (DZ) twins; 50% female; 64% White, 14% African American, 12% Latinx/Hispanic, 10% multiracial/other). We estimated univariate twin ACE decompositions for the number of pain sites, sleep disturbances, and intent to use substances as well as pairwise bivariate Cholesky decompositions across phenotypes.
We found variation in pain attributable to additive genetic and unique environmental influences. Variation in sleep disturbances was due to additive genetic, unique environmental, and shared environmental influences. Variation in substance use intent was due to additive genetic and unique environmental influences. There was some evidence of shared genetic etiology across pain and sleep, and some evidence of shared environmental etiology across pain and substance use intent.
Findings highlight the importance of examining shared genetic and environmental etiology underlying pain, sleep, and substance use in early adolescence, which can help identify transdiagnostic targets for early prevention and interventions of health issues.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-22">摘要</h3>
<p>Globally, caffeine is one of the most frequently consumed psychoactive substances and is present in drinks, food products, and medicines. Moderate caffeine consumption benefits health, acting as an antioxidant, cardiovascular protector, neuroprotective agent, etc. Caffeine extraction and analysis by conventional approaches usually depend on toxic solvents and produce large volumes of waste, which constitutes an environmental challenge. Green analytical chemistry has been developed to provide sustainable alternatives that are green, affordable, and less hazardous methods. This article covers various green extraction methods. It also highlights green analytical techniques for caffeine determination while focusing on the reduction of solvent utilization and waste generation. Using different matrices, green electrochemical and fluorescence-based sensors are created for the sensitive and quick detection of caffeine. The expanding use of green chemistry principles for caffeine analysis is indicative of a growing need for further exploration and discovery of sustainable practices in the food, beverage, and pharmaceutical industries. This review presents a comprehensive overview of caffeine, emphasizing green extraction techniques, sustainable analytical approaches, and recent advances in electrochemical sensor and Fluorescence sensor applications.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-23">摘要</h3>
<p>The transition from inpatient rehabilitation to community living poses significant challenges for individuals with newly acquired disabilities. Peer navigators, individuals with lived experience, are trained to support this transition; however, accessing in-person services can be difficult. To facilitate remote peer support and ensure accessibility, we co-designed a mobile health (mHealth) app with four peer navigators with disabilities. Over the course of three co-design sessions, we developed personas and iteratively refined low- and high-fidelity prototypes. We then conducted a heuristic evaluation with 22 human-computer interaction students to identify usability flaws. Based on this evaluation and feedback from a follow-up focus group with three students, we implemented iterative improvements to enhance usability and interactivity. This paper discusses the design implications and lessons learned for designing mHealth tools in collaboration with people with disabilities.
Mobile health apps that support remote peer navigator interventions could offer a promising approach to enhancing support for individuals newly diagnosed with disabilities.Co-designing with peer navigators with disabilities helped ensure that the app is usable, accessible, and engaging, tailored to the specific needs of users.Conducting heuristic evaluations ensured the app met high usability standards, which are essential for supporting a personalized rehabilitation experience.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-25">摘要</h3>
<p>Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most common vector-borne disease in Europe. At least 29 European Economic Area (EEA) countries publish online LB surveillance reports. However, countries have different criteria for what is notifiable for LB surveillance, limiting comparability. EEA countries began reporting Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) cases, a disseminated LB manifestation, to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in 2018, using a uniform case definition. This analysis compared LNB data from ECDC and national surveillance reports to evaluate their utility in monitoring LB in Europe. LNB surveillance data from 2018 to 2023 were downloaded from ECDC. Nationally reported online LB surveillance data from EEA countries were identified and reviewed. Countries that reported LNB cases in national surveillance and to ECDC were included and case data were compared. Of 31 EEA countries during 2018 to 2023, 11 (35 %) differentiated LNB cases in their national published LB surveillance; eight of these also reported to ECDC. The number of LNB cases published in national reports in these eight countries did not exactly match the number of LNB cases reported to ECDC but overall disease trends were similar. Comparing the LNB cases from eight countries in ECDC and national surveillance demonstrates that both capture evolving LNB disease trends despite some differences in the number of cases reported to each. To allow for more robust comparisons of LB burden and trends across Europe, harmonizing case definitions and reporting mechanisms for LB would provide great value.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-26">摘要</h3>
<p>Timely surgical resection is an important component of treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) is a validated, composite metric for social determinants of health. This study aimed to determine whether social vulnerability is associated with delayed surgery for NSCLC.
The study identified patients with stages IA to IIIA NSCLC who underwent upfront surgery between 2011 and 2021 in a single health care system. High social vulnerability was defined as SVI ≥ 75th percentile. Delayed surgery was defined as longer than 9 weeks after diagnosis. Unadjusted and risk-adjusted predictors of delayed surgery were identified. Time to surgery also was analyzed as a continuous variable. A negative binomial model was fitted to assess the individual impact of social vulnerability on time to surgery in days.
Of 595 patients, 120 (20 %) had high social vulnerability. A greater proportion of vulnerable patients experienced surgical delay (32 % vs 16 %; p &lt; 0.001) and had a significantly longer time to surgery (median, 49 days [interquartile range {IQR}, 19-84 days] vs 32 days [IQR, 0-57 days]; p &lt; 0.001). After risk adjustment, high social vulnerability was associated with 2.3 times higher odds of surgical delay (95 % confidence interval [CI], 1.4-3.7), and vulnerable patients waited a risk-adjusted median of 29 days longer for surgery. Surgical delay was significantly associated with pathologic upstaging (43 % vs 23 %; p &lt; 0.001).
High social vulnerability is associated with surgical delay in NSCLC, even after controlling for demographic and clinical factors. Delay is subsequently associated with pathologic upstaging. These findings warrant interventions for vulnerable patients to promote equitable surgical care.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-27">摘要</h3>
<p>The steroid hormone cortisol plays crucial roles in innate stress response, downregulation of inflammation, and promotion of glucose homeostasis. Infants born extremely preterm may be prone to cardiovascular compromise and inflammation-mediated respiratory disease due in part to insufficient cortisol production. Current data show that hydrocortisone, the exogenous medication form of cortisol, may help prevent or treat complications associated with relative adrenal insufficiency, although the full balance of treatment risks and benefits is uncertain. Prophylactic administration of hydrocortisone beginning in the first 1-2 postnatal days in extremely preterm infants likely results in earlier initial weaning from invasive ventilation and may reduce in-hospital mortality and the composite outcome of death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). However, such use may increase the risk of sepsis in infants born less than 26 weeks’ gestation and gastrointestinal perforation with concurrent exposure to indomethacin. Whether prophylactic hydrocortisone affects childhood neurodevelopment has not been adequately studied. Initiation of hydrocortisone after the first postnatal week in infants receiving invasive ventilation promotes successful extubation but does not affect risks of mortality, BPD, or neurodevelopmental impairment. In extremely preterm infants with hypotension, hydrocortisone can increase blood pressure, but short- and long-term safety for this indication and usefulness compared to other anti-hypotensive agents are not well established.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-28">摘要</h3>
<p>This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of yoga interventions in individuals with intellectual disabilities (ID), a population vulnerable to physical and mental health issues and in need of accessible, holistic therapies.
Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search was conducted in Web of Science, PubMed, SPORTDiscus, and Scopus up to March 2025. Study quality was assessed using PEDro and MINORS tools.
Ten studies involving 518 participants met inclusion criteria. Yoga interventions (ranging from five weeks to 10 months) showed significant within-group improvements in balance, anthropometric measures, pulmonary and cardiovascular parameters. Between-group differences favored yoga over no intervention, although benefits were often comparable to other exercise modalities. Methodological quality was mostly “good” for RCTs, but lower for comparative studies.
Yoga appears to be a promising strategy for improving balance, anthropometric parameters, and pulmonary function in individuals with ID.
Yoga can be integrated as a complementary strategy within intervention programs for individuals with intellectual disabilities, particularly when the goal is to improve balance, anthropometric parameters, and pulmonary function.Rehabilitation professionals may prescribe structured yoga programs lasting at least five weeks, with three or more sessions per week of 45–60 min, as a feasible and safe option.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-29">摘要</h3>
<p>The Joint Action project on Cancer and other Non-communicable Diseases (NCDs) prevention, Action on Health Determinants, includes a dedicated workstream on structural and population-level interventions. The overarching objective of this workstream is to strengthen the compliance, coherence, implementation and enforcement of evidence-based regulatory measures that support governmental efforts to reduce the burden of NCDs.
The workstream adopts a multi-method approach, informed by existing academic literature and previous European studies. Key methodologies include policy mapping, evidence reviews, behavioural assessments, policy impact modelling, and pilot testing. Governmental alcohol and tobacco policies will be evaluated using comparative policy scales, while the health and economic impacts of health taxation policies will be projected through and microsimulation modelling. Nutrient profile modelling and food composition databases will be developed to inform strategies for food reformulation. The effectiveness of labelling interventions will be examined. Tools for monitoring digital marketing exposure will be developed, and the impact of environmental policy impact will be assessed.
The workstream is expected to deliver comprehensive policy analyses, demonstrate the potential impact of health taxation, propose harmonized nutrient profiling frameworks, assess the effectiveness of food and alcohol labelling practices and contribute to the development of cross-national structures for public food procurement. Additionally, it will provide guidance on the implementation of effective measures and evaluate divergences in national policy approaches across Europe.
The workstream will generate actionable evidence and documentation to inform and support public policy processes, thereby contributing to reductions in the burden of preventable disease across the region.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-30">摘要</h3>
<p>Antimicrobial resistance is a growing global health threat that disproportionately affects socially and economically disadvantaged populations. National Action Plans are critical for coordinating national responses, but the extent to which they address equity remains unclear. This study assessed how antimicrobial resistance National Action Plans from 14 West African countries incorporate equity considerations.
We reviewed antimicrobial resistance National Action Plans from 14 West African countries using a four-domain equity framework: (1) recognition of equity, (2) identification of vulnerable populations, (3) inclusion of equity-oriented interventions and (4) integration of equity into governance and monitoring. We assessed whether National Action Plans acknowledged 16 high-risk groups, including people living with HIV, displaced or mobile populations, children and adolescents, older adults, people with mental health disorders, rural residents, people with chronic illnesses, people living with disabilities, pregnant women, low-income populations, healthcare workers, people with substance use disorders, incarcerated populations, indigenous or minority groups, homeless populations and migrants or seasonal workers.
All National Action Plans adopted a One Health approach, but equity was inconsistently addressed. Most did not explicitly reference equity, and none included equity-related indicators in monitoring frameworks. Healthcare workers and rural populations were the most frequently mentioned groups. Common interventions included hygiene promotion, public awareness campaigns and training of healthcare workers, but these were largely generic and rarely adapted to the specific needs of marginalised populations. Stakeholder engagement was often multisectoral but seldom ensured the participation of disadvantaged groups. Across the region, the lack of disaggregated data and tailored strategies highlights a significant equity gap.
Equity remains insufficiently integrated into antimicrobial resistance governance in West Africa. Future National Action Plans must explicitly identify at-risk populations, include equity indicators and involve affected communities in planning and oversight. Embedding equity is essential to building resilient and people-centred antimicrobial resistance strategies.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-31">摘要</h3>
<p>In recent years, laparoscopic anatomical liver resection (LALR) has gained recognition for its efficacy and safety.1,2 However, segments VII and VIII remain challenging due to their deep location and proximity to major vessels.3 Inadvertent manipulation can easily cause serious complications including massive bleeding and CO2 gas embolism. Therefore, we propose an innovative ultrasonic scalpel scraping technique for hepatic vessel skeletonization in LALR.
A male patient was admitted with hepatic mass. Three-dimensional liver modeling showed the tumor located in segment VIII without major vessel invasion. The liver parenchyma dissecting-first ventral approach was used. Inflow occlusion was managed by an intermittent Pringle maneuver using a Foley catheter. Initially, liver parenchyma transection was attempted without inflow occlusion, but as the transverse plane deepened and the skeletal process of the middle hepatic vein(MHV), right hepatic vein(RHV), and VIII Glisson segment progressed, the Pringle maneuver was applied to enhance safety and visibility. During parenchymal dissection, the ultrasonic scalpel remained in a continuously activated state, scraping back and forth between the liver parenchyma and the surface of blood vessels (Fig. 1). The activated working surface maintained close liver contact throughout. Small vessels and bile ducts were directly coagulated and sealed by ultrasonic energy, avoiding injury to deep structures. During vessel skeletonization, the ultrasonic scalpel was positioned at 15-30° angles, gently separating parenchyma covering vessels through scraping rather than clamping. This method avoided vessel damage from tissue clamping. Even brief adventitial contact caused no vascular injury. During this process, small venous branches of the MHV and RHV were sometimes severed, producing small holes in venous walls. Most were immediately sealed by ultrasonic energy, while persistent oozing was controlled with bipolar coagulation. A small portion needed to be treated with Hem-o-Lock clips or 5-0/6-0 Prolene sutures. Fig. 1 Demonstration of ultrasonic scalpel scraping technology RESULTS: A total of six cycles of inflow occlusion were performed using the Pringle maneuver, with a cumulative clamping time of 90 min. Operative time was 280 min and blood loss was 100 ml. Histopathological diagnosis was moderately differentiated intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. No postoperative complications occurred and the patient was discharged 7 days after surgery.
The continuously activated ultrasonic scalpel scraping technique in LALR not only achieves rapid vessel skeletonization, but also ensures vessel integrity.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-33">摘要</h3>
<p>To establish reliability and construct validity of a Norwegian version of the social cognition test, the Awareness of Social Inference Test (N-TASIT). Participants with traumatic brain injury (TBI; n = 101) and 50 matched healthy controls performed either a virtual reality (VR) or 2D version of N-TASIT at baseline and 16 weeks later. Reliability measures were test-retest reliability and internal consistency. Intraclass correlation (ICC) and Cronbach’s alpha (α) were calculated for the overall sample and both groups separately. Construct validity was tested with known groups validity, convergent and discriminant validity. Known groups analysis was conducted for both versions separately and combined. Convergent and discriminant validity were determined by associations between N-TASIT and established measures of social cognition and with measures of cognition, emotional distress and fatigue. ICC for the total sample was 0.63 (95% CI 0.49-0.73), and α was 0.88, when presentation modes (VR and 2D) were combined. The healthy control group outperformed the TBI group in both presentation modes. Medium-to-large associations were found between N-TASIT performance and social cognitive measures, and mostly weak or no significant correlations with non-social domains. N-TASIT appears psychometrically sound and comparable to the original. The influence of presentation mode on performance remains unclear.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-34">摘要</h3>
<p>Emotional intelligence refers to the ability to recognise, understand, manage, and effectively use one’s emotions and respond appropriately to the emotions of others. Positive parent-child relationships can provide a supportive environment for the development of emotional intelligence.
This research aimed to evaluate the relationship between emotional intelligence and the dynamics of adolescents’ parent-child relationships, which further influence academic and psychological well-being. The emotional intelligence inventory was used to assess emotional intelligence, whereas the parent-child relationship scale was used to measure parent-child relationship quality. A convenience sampling technique was adopted to collect data from 500 adolescents through an online mode.
Most of the adolescents exhibited moderate to high emotional intelligence and maintained relationships with their parents that ranged from above average to exceptionally balanced. The statistical analysis revealed a weak negative correlation between emotional intelligence quality and the parent-child relationship (p = 0.002). The research findings emphasise a weak but statistically significant correlation (r = -0.136) between emotional intelligence and the relationship between parents and children. Compared with adolescents from rural areas, those from urban areas presented greater emotional intelligence. Additionally, those with higher birth order and belonging to joint families exhibited cordial relationships with their parents.
Promotion of parent-child interaction and nurturing of harmonious relationships are crucial for the development of emotional intelligence among adolescents, which requires parents to guide and enhance emotional management.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-35">摘要</h3>
<p>Widespread social media use presents an opportunity for health promotion among adolescents with chronic health conditions (CHCs), but rapid changes in technology preferences and affordances pose a challenge for researchers whose work progresses more slowly. The purpose of this systematic scoping review is to describe the size, range, and characteristics of contemporary research efforts (between 2018 and 2024) to investigate social media interventions for adolescents with CHCs. We searched six databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CINAHL, and ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses Global) and sought additional grey literature. Inclusion criteria were studies designing, user-testing, evaluating, or otherwise investigating social media interventions for adolescents with CHCs. Two independent reviewers screened abstracts, assessed full-text articles, and extracted variables using Covidence. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses-Scoping guidelines. Twenty-five research projects met the inclusion criteria. The most common theories/frameworks were social cognitive theory, cognitive behavioral theory, social support theories, design theories, and participatory frameworks. The interventions all targeted single diagnoses (most often type 1 diabetes and human immunodeficiency virus). The predominant intervention strategy was to facilitate education, peer support, and discussion within text-based online communities. The most popular contemporary platforms and short-form videos were underutilized. Outcomes included variables related to the youth’s intervention experience (e.g., usability, engagement); internal, proximal variables (e.g., self-efficacy, stigma); relational, proximal variables (e.g., social support, connection to the clinic); health behaviors (e.g., treatment adherence, transition readiness); and overall impacts on health and well-being (e.g., health status indicators, quality of life). Although theoretical frameworks, methods, and outcomes were wide-ranging, the specific intervention strategies were more limited in variety. Future research efforts should investigate whether embedding interventions in social media platforms youth use in their everyday lives and integrating public health and implementation science methods result in greater engagement or improved outcomes.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-37">摘要</h3>
<p>Research training and research collaboration have been identified as a means of improving the standing and impact of occupational health and hygiene (OHH) professionals, especially in rapidly industrializing countries. The 2 key measures of research achievement relate to publication in high-impact (Q1) peer-reviewed journals and awarding of competitive research grants. However, there appears to be little formal research training guidance in the OHH field. In order to address the OHH training need, 2 introductory modules addressing publications and grants were developed by the University of Adelaide and the University of Indonesia and trialled in Indonesia.
The Carpe Diem course design approach, with team-based storyboarding, was used. The training was delivered in hybrid mode to postgraduate and PhD students and early career researchers. The modules provided a focus on the value and context of OHH research and key elements scrutinized by editors, reviewers, and selection panels. Characterization of research “players,” gamification and storytelling were used to enhance interest amongst the relatively young audience.
Feedback from participants was positive, including design, interest, and meeting expectations. In an online survey, respondents stated that they would attend a similar training activity, and 96% would recommend this training to others.
This research training activity is the first to focus on OHH research, and was successfully piloted in a country where industry and occupational hygiene are rapidly growing. Young researchers appreciated the novel learning design. Research training in developing countries may assist in making untapped exposure data available, expanding and enriching the OHH literature.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-38">摘要</h3>
<p>Psychosocial stressors at work, including job strain and effort-reward imbalance (ERI), have been associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). However, the proportion of CHD events attributable to these exposures has not been quantified in a prospective cohort study.
The purpose of this study was to estimate the fraction of CHD events attributable to psychosocial stressors at work in a 20-year prospective cohort study.
This prospective cohort study included employees from public and semipublic organizations in Quebec City, Canada, followed from 2004 and 2018. A total of 6,295 participants without cardiovascular disease at baseline were included. Job strain and ERI were assessed using validated instruments. Incident CHD events were identified through universally covered health care databases. Attributable fractions were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multiple imputation and inverse probability weighting were applied to address selection and confounding. The first 5 years of follow-up were excluded to minimize reverse causation.
During 15-year follow-up, 669 CHD events occurred over 112,297 person-years, yielding a CHD incidence rate of 5.96 per 1,000 person-years. The attributable fraction for job strain was 18.2% (95% CI: 1.8%-34.7%), and for ERI, it was 3.3% (95% CI: -1.6% to 8.2%). Combined exposure to both stressors resulted in an attributable fraction of 19.5% (95% CI: 0.7%-38.4%).
In this cohort, combined exposure to job strain and ERI accounted for approximately one-fifth of CHD events. Findings suggest that psychosocial stressors at work could be relevant targets for reducing the burden of CHD through prevention strategies.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-39">摘要</h3>
<p>To identify reliable imaging variables for differentiating cystic lesions by integrating qualitative, semiquantitative, and quantitative features.
A retrospective analysis of 100 histologically confirmed cystic sellar-suprasellar lesions was performed using preoperative CT and MRI. Qualitative (topography, type, shape, intracystic components, edema, calcifications), semiquantitative (wall thickness), and quantitative (intracystic signal intensity from T2- and pre-contrast T1-weighted MRI) features were assessed. Multivariable models were developed by combining the most reliable imaging variables specific to each cystic lesion category.
Lesions were categorized as Rathke’s cysts (RCC, 39), papillary (PCP, 14) and adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas (ACP, 21), pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (PitNets, 18), arachnoid cysts (AC, 8). No clinical presentation was pathognomonic. Multivariable models showed high diagnostic accuracy: 82 % for RCC identifying wall thickness &lt; 1 mm (OR 7.160, p = 0.009) and low T2min (OR 1.043, p = 0.006) as key predictors; 89 % for PCP despite the absence of distinct independent predictors; 89 % for ACP with parietal calcifications identified as the strongest predictor (OR 0.043, p &lt; 0.001); 90 % for PitNets identifying wall thickness &gt; 2 mm as the strongest predictor (OR 0.52, p &lt; 0.001); and 97 % for AC identifying wall thickness &lt; 1 mm (OR 10.983, p = 0.019) and high T2min (OR 0.947, p = 0.039) as key predictors.
No single variable was sufficient for diagnosis but integrating specific and sensitive imaging features improved cystic lesion differentiation, aiding accurate diagnosis and management.</p>

<p>To: (1) explore the factors influencing the offering of venous leg ulcer (VLU) recurrence preventative treatments from the perspective of NHS nurses, and (2) recommend potential intervention strategies to ameliorate inhibitors to offering those preventative treatments.
This qualitative study used semi-structured online interviews with seventeen NHS nurses who provide wound care. The interviews were guided by the Capabilities, Opportunities and Motivation model of Behaviour change (COM-B). Framework Analysis, incorporating inductive coding to capture emergent themes and deductive coding informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) was conducted. NVivo software aided data management, and coding was conducted collaboratively by an interdisciplinary team.
Data were mapped to six relevant TDF domains. Three of these domains were found to influence offering of both preventative treatments. While nurses understood the importance of VLU care post-healing, there was a perception of limited provision of prophylactic treatments in NHS organisations (environmental context and resources), which can be reflected in the lack of embedding national guidelines into local pathways (memory, attention and decision processes). Nevertheless, some nurses acknowledged the significance of their role in offering those prophylaxis with their patients (social/professional role and identity). In addition to the primary three domains, two more domains were identified influencing offering of prophylactic compression. While some nurses lacked confidence in offering the strongest tolerated compression (beliefs about capability), working within an experienced team was perceived to enhance their confidence and support optimal prescription of prophylactic compression. Furthermore, with the primary three domains, one additional domain was identified influencing referrals to vascular services. Nurses interviewed were largely unaware of endo-venous ablation surgery as a prophylactic treatment option for people with healed VLUs (knowledge). Five intervention functions (environmental restructuring, enablement, education, modelling and persuasion), and nine behaviours change technique groupings (goals and planning, antecedents, associations, self-belief, comparison of behaviour, repetition and substitution, comparison of outcomes, social support and shaping knowledge) were identified.
The identified intervention functions and the behaviour change techniques can inform the design of future intervention. Key targets for change include service-focused elements on VLU care after healing and the integration of national guidelines with local resources to aid decision-making and boost opportunities to offer evidence-based approaches to reduce or prevent recurrence of VLUs.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-41">摘要</h3>
<p>DNA methylation represents a crucial epigenetic mechanism orchestrating gene expression, cellular homeostasis, and the aging trajectory. Dysregulation of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs)-the enzymes catalyzing this process-has been implicated in a wide spectrum of chronic conditions, including cancer, cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. Emerging evidence suggests that food-derived bioactive compounds can act as DNMT inhibitors, reshaping epigenetic landscapes. This systematic review, registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022320316), critically evaluated in vitro, in vivo animal, and ex vivo studies investigating the effects of dietary bioactives on DNMT expression and activity. A thorough search of PubMed up to May 23, 2025, yielded 103 studies, of which 76 met the inclusion criteria. Eligible publications were original, peer-reviewed, and provided evidence from in vitro, in vivo animal, or ex vivo models. Frequent candidates included epigallocatechin-3-gallate, curcumin, genistein, resveratrol, sulforaphane, and folate. Notably, nearly 90% of studies reported DNMT inhibition-often dose- and time-dependent. Approximately 21% defined minimal effective concentrations, predominantly for isolated compounds. Several studies described synergistic interactions between bioactives, and emerging data highlighted the gut microbiota’s mediating role in epigenetic modulation. Despite promising outcomes, the predominance of preclinical evidence and variability in experimental protocols and dosing limit immediate translational impact. Nonetheless, current findings underscore the promise of dietary DNMT modulators as foundational elements for precision nutrition strategies aimed at promoting healthy aging and mitigating age-associated disease risk. The potential application of DNA methylation age (DNAmAge) as a biomarker of biological aging has been increasingly supported by recent literature, reinforcing its relevance in future nutritional epigenetics research. Further well-designed clinical trials are warranted to assess long-term efficacy, safety, and bioavailability of these compounds, and to validate their use in personalized epigenetic interventions, using biological aging markers. This review was funded by the European Union-Next Generation EU, PNRR Project Age-It (DM 1557 11.10.2022), and the University of Padua SID Grant (2024DCTV1SIDPROGETTI-00194).</p>

<h3 id="摘要-42">摘要</h3>
<p>Silica exposure can cause silicosis, and its pathogenesis is not fully understood. This study investigates the role of immune checkpoint lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3) in silicosis. Mice were intratracheally exposed to silica, and tissues were collected and analyzed after 7 and 28 days. Additionally, peripheral blood samples were also collected from silicosis patients. The mRNA and protein expression levels of LAG3 in various tissues were quantified using qRT-PCR and western blot techniques. The localization of LAG3 in the lung, spleen, thymus and hilar lymph nodes was visualized by immunochemistry. Our data showed that silica exposure induced systemic changes in LAG3 expression in an organ-specific manner. In mouse lungs, LAG3 levels were significantly upregulated after silica exposure. In mouse spleen, LAG3 expression changed only during early stage of silica exposure. In mouse thymus, the level of LAG3 decreased during early stage of silica exposure but reversed to increase during late stage. In mouse hilar lymph nodes, expression of LAG3 increased significantly. A marked increase in the concentration of soluble LAG3 was observed in the plasma of mice exposed to silica. Plasma soluble LAG3 levels in silicosis patients were found to be significantly higher than healthy controls. These findings suggest that LAG3 may be involved in the pathogenesis of silicosis and that immune disorders in lung tissue may further affect systemic immune homeostasis.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-43">摘要</h3>
<p>Prevotella bivia is an anaerobic Gram-negative bacillus commonly associated with pelvic and genital tract infections. Its isolation from breast abscesses, particularly in nonpuerperal women, is extremely uncommon.
We report a unique case of a 40-year-old non- lactating woman presenting with a recurrent right breast abscess. The pa- tient experienced three episodes over three years (2022-2025); only the fourth episode was microbiologically confirmed as being caused by P. bivia, identi- fied using MALDI-TOF MS. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed resistance to ampicillin and susceptibility to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and other agents.
The case underlines the critical role of anaerobic cultures and advanced identification techniques in recurrent breast infections. Although microbiological confirmation was achieved only in the latest episode, the recurrent clinical picture suggests a difficult-to-culture microbial aetiology.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-44">摘要</h3>
<p>Desert kangaroo rats (Dipodomys deserti) construct burrows that create protected micro-niches favorable to increased microbial activity and biofilm formation. Biofilms within these burrows bind sand particles together, increase the tensile strength of the burrow sand and burrow stability. Our previous work 1) demonstrated that kangaroo rat burrow sand exhibits higher tensile strength than surrounding surface sand due to the cementation by biofilms, and 2) characterized the microbial biofilm communities within kangaroo rat burrow sand and isolated abundant microorganisms. In this study, isolated species are used to quantify tensile strength of pure and mixed biofilms using the microcantilever technique. Mono-species biofilms of Aspergillus tamarii (59.30 ± 4.36 kPa) exhibited the highest tensile strength, while Neobacillus niacini (9.45 ± 1.98 kPa) showed the lowest. Dual-species biofilms displayed synergistic or antagonistic effects, depending on species combinations. Mixing N. niacini with Peribacillus frigoritolerans increased tensile strength to 55.11 ± 2.51 kPa, whereas combining A. tamarii with N. niacini reduced the tensile strength to 18.98 ± 2.54 kPa. Mixing up to five species reduced tensile strength to a minimum value of 2.16 kPa. We conclude that biofilms formed by microbial isolates from burrow sand individually had higher tensile strength, but when all were mixed, the tensile strength decreased, making them weaker.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-45">摘要</h3>
<p>Detection of pesticide residues is important due to their significant environmental side effects and public health concern. Herein, a facile and sensitive approach was developed based on dual emission ratiometric fluorescence signal for detection of acetamiprid (ACE) pesticide. The sensing platform was based on MWCNTs/ AuNPs nanocomposite to generate the output signals. The fluorescent FAM-functionalized aptamer with stem-loop structure was deposited on platform which resulted to fluorescence quenching during FRET process via extinction of MWCNTs/ AuNPs. Upon addition of ACE, aptamer structure was unfolded and specific sequence as the toehold was hybridized with another complementary Cy5 labeled probe. Following, FAM segment was displaced and its fluorescence signal was recovered while the fluorescence emission of Cy5 was quenched by FRET process in proximity of nanocomposite. The biosensor showed efficient detection performance in the linear range between 4 and 40 pM and the LOD was calculated at 2.8 pM. Selectivity of present strategy was confirmed among different applied targets and the real sample assay showed efficient performance in bell pepper samples. Thus, this strategy indicated sensitive and efficient performance for detection of ACE in agricultural product and food stuffs.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-46">摘要</h3>
<p>Microplastic pollution, as an emerging and toxic pollutant, has become a major concern in aquatic ecosystems, including dams. Given that very little research has been conducted in this field, this article reviews this environmental challenge. In this paper, the origin, shape, color, polymer nature, and consequences of the presence of microplastics (MPs) in dams around the world were investigated based on limited published research. The dominant shape, color, and polymer nature in dams were found to be fiber, white, and polyethylene (PET), respectively. Given the increasing distribution of MPs in aquatic resources, special attention was paid to the prospects and management strategies for their mitigation.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-47">摘要</h3>
<p>Predicting bacterial behavior and strain variability is essential for quantitative microbial risk assessments in food safety. The growing availability of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data enables deeper insights into microbial thermotolerance. However, capturing the reduction behavior of Campylobacter jejuni during thermal inactivation, while accounting for strain variability, remains challenging. We aimed to develop a machine-learning model leveraging amino acid phylogenetic information from WGS data to predict the reduction behavior and strain variability of C. jejuni during thermal inactivation. We developed a machine learning model utilizing 38 complete genomes of C. jejuni and their parameters of modified Weibull models describing the reduction behaviors heated at 55 °C. Correlation analyses identified genes that could be relevant to thermotolerance and highlighted genes potentially linked to thermotolerance. Leave-one-out cross-validation yielded a root mean square error of 0.83 log. Strain variability was further estimated using 679 genomes from genomic databases. Strain variability exhibited a multimodal distribution with one prominent peak and three minor peaks, indicating that traditional unimodal distributions could not fully represent the variability in C. jejuni thermal reduction. The machine-learning model effectively predicted reduction behavior and strain variability of C. jejuni during thermal inactivation using WGS data. Nonetheless, its prediction range is limited by the diversity of the training set, suggesting that broader genomic datasets could enhance accuracy. These findings provide a pathway for improved microbial risk assessments through genomic data integration.</p>

<p>To characterize the auditory cortex (AC) in patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and to assess the effect of ageing using Magnetic Resonance Imaging.
Multicenter, cross-sectional study. Data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were analyzed, including 200 patients with AD, 200 elderly controls, and 200 individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Volumes of the Heschl’s gyrus, Planum Temporale and Planum Polare-corresponding to the primary, secondary and association AC, respectively- were obtained using Freesurfer. Regional volumes were normalized to intracranial volume and compared between groups, considering age and sex.
Patients with AD showed significantly lower AC volumes compared with individuals with MCI and elderly controls. In addition, AC volumes declined with increasing age, though this reduction was less pronounced in the left Planum Temporale and left Heschl’s gyrus of AD patients. In multivariate analysis, both age and AD diagnosis were independent negative predictors, with the effect of AD being more pronounced, even after adjusting for age.
The AC is significantly affected in AD. Furthermore, AC volumes decline with ageing across all regions, although the reduction is less evident in the secondary AC and left primary AC of AD patients. Patients with MCI showed relative preservation of the primary AC and left secondary AC compared with AD patients.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-49">摘要</h3>
<p>Acute liver failure (ALF) is a life-threatening disease for which orthotopic liver transplantation remains one of the most effective treatments. Cell therapy, particularly through the transplantation of artificial bioengineered liver grafts, emerges as a promising alternative to the whole liver transplantation in ALF management. However, the limited availability of functional human hepatocytes, the constrained techniques for swiftly creating artificial bioengineered liver grafts, and the poor cellular survival post-transplantation present significant challenges for advancing clinical applications in liver regeneration. In this study, we introduce a novel approach utilizing microfluidics to create cell-laden microgels for fabricating artificial liver microtissues, in which the controlled hepatic differentiation of stem cells and the development of liver microtissues are incorporated. The cell-laden ARGH microgels (GelMA/HAMA microgels containing AuNCs-miRNA) serving as building blocks for rapid engineering tissue construction, demonstrate the capacity for the one-step promotion of hepatic differentiation of stem cells for a short period of time. Additionally, the bioengineered liver microtissues exhibit multiple biological functionalities, including scavenging ROS, modulating inflammatory environment, and promoting angiogenesis, and can maintain long-term stability after transplantation in vivo. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the in vivo transplantation of the bioengineered liver microtissues offers therapeutic benefits in two drug-induced liver failure experimental models. The transcriptome sequencing analysis further elucidates that the microtissue transplantation ameliorated liver failure by improving liver biofunctions, reducing inflammation and oxidative stress, thereby promoting liver regeneration. Overall, this study presents an effective approach leveraging functional biomaterials and microfluidic techniques to fabricate artificial liver microtissues for liver failure treatment.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-50">摘要</h3>
<p>Sociality offers benefits to species that can enhance their fitness. However, pathogen transmission can be higher in larger groups, potentially negating the advantages of group living. Despite the important paradoxical effects of population density on disease impacts and recovery, the competing effects of density remain unexplored. Here, we examine the response of a social bat species to pathogen invasion by comparing the effect of colony size on disease impacts during the summer (disease-free period) and winter (disease period). During pathogen invasion, larger winter colonies initially experienced relatively higher declines than smaller colonies. Conversely, summer colony size positively influenced colony growth immediately following pathogen invasion and during recovery, suggesting that Allee effects may be important in population resilience. Our results show that hosts faced with a novel pathogen may experience both benefits and costs of group living, and balancing these competing effects could impede evolutionary selection pressure toward asociality.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-51">摘要</h3>
<p>Older populations are prone to various chronic diseases and takes polypharmacy, which can lead to potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs), causing several complications. This research aimed to estimate PIMs and potential prescribing omissions (PPOs) in older adults via the STOPP/START criteria, version 3.
This multicentric retrospective observational study was executed among subjects aged ≥ 65 years, who were hospitalized at two Ministry hospitals from July 2023 to June 2024. The medicines of the geriatric population were assessed for PIMs/PPOs via the STOPP/START criteria, version 3. The data were scrutinized via SPPSS 27. Descriptive statistics were performed for qualitative and quantitative data. Multinomial logistic regression was applied to evaluate the effects of sex, age, comorbidities and medicines on PIMs and PPOs. Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to evaluate potential multicollinearity among the predictors associated with PIMs and PPOs.
In total, 385 subjects were included in this study. The participants’ mean age was 75.7 ± 8.76 years and 50.13% were male. Among the study population, 48.83% had potentially inappropriate prescriptions, 37.66% with PIMs and 20.52% with PPOs. In total, 190 PIMs and 108 PPOs were identified, and the most frequently prescribed PIM was calcium channel blockers (20%). Comorbidities were significantly associated with PIMs and PPOs.
Overall, 48.83% of the prescriptions were potentially inappropriate. The percentage of PIMs/PPOs is lower in our population than in previous versions of the STOPP/START criteria. However, scheduled audits should be performed to keep the PIMs/PPOs at the lowest range. A comprehensive list of medications that are appropriate or inappropriate for use in older adults should be established, and prescribers should consult this list before prescribing to help prevent potentially inappropriate prescriptions.</p>

<p>Value-based healthcare addresses inefficiencies, rising costs, and inconsistent quality by prioritising patient outcomes relative to costs. Despite broad support, its definition and implementation remain unclear. This perspective proposes a systemic, person-centred approach that aligns stakeholders around shared values. We examine frameworks like Berwick’s ‘Triple Aim’ and Porter’s patient-centred model, and integrat Sir Muir Gray’s moral dimension for a holistic perspective. Achieving an effective system requires committed leadership, bottom-up redesign integrating all care levels, and cross-sector collaboration to align policies with sustainable health improvements.

<h3 id="摘要-53">摘要</h3>
<p>Although testimonies of devastating impacts of care delivered in nondesignated hospital areas (corridor care) are mounting, there is a paucity of quantitative data. This study aimed to assess the associations between: (1) care in nondesignated areas and key performance indicators (KPIs), including ward moves and length of stay (LOS); and (2) between KPIs and mortality.
Data from this cross-sectional study were derived from the National Hip Fracture Database audit programme (a quality-improvement initiative commissioned by the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership, NHS England). In total, 508 patients (65% women) consecutively admitted with hip fractures (January 2024-January 2025) were included. The duration (h:min) of care in nondesignated areas was categorised by tertiles (&lt; 1:20; 1:20-4:20; &gt; 4:20). Associations between variables were determined by logistic regression, presented as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals.
Patients cared for in nondesignated areas (11%) and bed care patients (89%) had similar clinical characteristics (median age = 85.5 years). Care in nondesignated areas varied inversely with seasonal average local temperatures: 10.7% in summer (22.5°C), 19.6% autumn (15.9°C), 44.6% winter (8.6°C), and 25.0% spring (14.9°C), which was more discernible than the corresponding distribution of bed care: 21.2%, 23.7%, 25.9% and 29.2%. Compared with bed care patients, those cared for in nondesignated areas for ≥ 1 h:20 min were associated with ≥ 3 ward moves: OR = 4.02 (1.61-10.06). LOS on orthogeriatric wards for bed care patients was 13.4 days, and care in nondesignated areas &gt; 4 h:20 min was 17.2 days, which increased to 19.7 days for all patients cared for in nondesignated areas with ≥ 3 ward moves. In turn, higher in-hospital mortality was associated with multiple ward moves: OR = 2.63 (1.23-5.66) and prolonged LOS: OR = 3.23 (1.53-6.81).
The impact of care delivered in nondesignated areas exposed by KPIs is consistent with testimonies from patients and NHS staff. This evidence serves as a stimulus to take urgent action to abolish care in nondesignated areas.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-54">摘要</h3>
<p>This study compared changes in handgrip strength (HGS) over 2 years in young athletes participating in two sports: kendo, which involves gripping equipment during play, and soccer, which does not.
One hundred eleven young athletes (54 kendo boys [mean age at baseline: 10.1 ± 1.7 years] and 57 soccer boys [mean age at baseline: 10.3 ± 1.8 years]) underwent three HGS measurements, spaced 1 year apart (Test 1, Test 2, and Test 3). The Q-Q plot indicated some violations of normality; therefore, we used a robust repeated measures ANOVA function in R.
We found evidence for a localized interaction effect (p = 0.02), with a sport difference in the change from Test 1 (baseline) to Test 3 and Test 2 to Test 3 (kendo &gt; soccer). There was no statistically significant main effect of sport (p = 0.06); however, kendo was on average 2.4 (95% CI: -0.08, 4.9) kg stronger than soccer athletes. When collapsing across groups, HGS increased from Test 1 to Test 2 by 1.9 (1.5, 2.3) kg, and from Test 2 to Test 3 by 2.8 (2.1, 3.6) kg.
Sports that involve gripping tools in conjunction with natural movements may help improve HGS during the developmental period.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-55">摘要</h3>
<p>Cancer is mainly caused by a relatively small portion of somatic genome alterations (SGAs), called cancer drivers. Despite success in identifying a good number of cancer drivers, many more remain to be discovered to explain various cancers. Moreover, limited tools are available to identify potential interactions among cancer drivers for a better understanding of oncogenesis. To tackle these challenges, we have developed a novel approach called individualized Bayesian inference using a decision tree (IBI-DT). IBI-DT recognizes the genetic heterogeneity among cancer patients, where different individuals or patient subgroups of distinct genomic makeup may have different drivers. IBI-DT works by constructing smaller subgroups with similar genetic makeup (i.e. patient-like-me subgroups) using a decision tree structure and analyzing multiple trees to identify the SGAs that play a significant role in regulating downstream gene expression patterns at the subgroup and individual levels. This is distinct from population-based approaches, which tend to evaluate the influence of an SGA for the entire population, thereby likely missing low-frequency SGAs that may well explain a small subgroup of cancer patients. Also importantly, IBI-DT can efficiently identify cancer drivers that may have functional interactions. We applied IBI-DT to identify cancer drivers regulating the downstream differential gene expression in cancer patients and compared it to the standard, population-based method of expression quantitative trait loci analysis. Our results show that IBI-DT performs well in identifying both important cancer drivers, especially the low-frequency drivers, and their interactions, allowing for a better understanding of the cancer signaling pathways.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-56">摘要</h3>
<p>Previous research indicates that constipation may be an early symptom of Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, it remains uncertain whether constipation is a unique symptom prior to PD or to other major neurological disorders as well. This study aimed to explore the association between premorbid constipation and three major neurological disorders: stroke, dementia and PD.
We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from UK Biobank. Constipation was defined based on diagnosed cases in electronic health records, self-reported instances or regular laxative use. The primary outcome was defined as the first onset of any of three neurological disorders: stroke, dementia and PD. Cox regression was used to adjust for socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, medical conditions and regular medication use.
Out of 462,327 eligible participants, those with constipation were associated with higher incidence of three outcome diseases (1415/20,263 [7.0%]) than those without (18,848/442,064 [4.3%]), with adjusted hazard ratio (HR) being 1.35 [1.27-1.42]. Specifically, those with constipation had a 20%, 50% and 56% higher risk of stroke, dementia and PD, respectively. Both self-reported and diagnosed constipation were associated with a higher risk of these conditions, with HR being 1.31 (1.23-1.40) and 1.44 (1.30-1.59), respectively. Interestingly, the association between constipation and neurological disorders was stronger within the first 2 years from baseline.
These findings support the biological link between constipation and neurological disorders. Given its potential role as a prodromal symptom for these diseases, both diagnosed and self-reported constipation should be considered in risk prediction models.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-57">摘要</h3>
<p>Oral cytology has been explored in the early identification of varied oral lesions, including potentially malignant disorders and oral carcinomas. One of the reasons for its lack of acceptance as a mass screening tool is the absence of a uniform oral cytologic grading system.
A systematic search of 5 databases was conducted. Original studies reporting diagnostic accuracy metrics (outcome) of oral classification systems were included followed by risk of bias via QUADAS-2 tool. Random effects model with DerSimonian and Laird method was used for meta-analysis.
A total of 9 studies comprising of 3163 samples were assessed. Majority of the studies investigated application and accuracy of modified 2014 Bethesda Cervical Cytology grading system in the oral cavity. The pooled sensitivity of the included studies was 0.74 (95% CI [0.65-0.82]) and the pooled specificity was 0.84 (95% CI [0.78-0.88]). High heterogeneity was observed amongst the included studies.
Variable methodology, sample collection tools, grading classes of modified 2014 Bethesda Cervical Cytology grading system and histopathology reference classes account for the high heterogeneity amongst the studies. Global consensus is required for such factors while conducting studies on oral cytology classification systems.</p>

<h2 id="article-59">59. Reaching Across the Divide: Integrating Equitable Community-Based Qualitative Methods and Trusted Engagement Strategies Into Arizona's Statewide Maternal and Child Community Assessment.</h2>

<h3 id="摘要-58">摘要</h3>
<p>Maternal mortality in the U.S. remains a pressing public health issue, with African American and Indigenous populations experiencing significantly higher rates. In Arizona, maternal mortality reached 30.0 deaths per 100,000 births in 2023, well above the national average. To address persistent maternal and child health (MCH) inequities, the Arizona Department of Health Services, in collaboration with a university and other strategic partners, conducted the 2025 Arizona Statewide Title V Maternal and Child Health Needs Assessment using community-engaged research (CeNR) approaches. Qualitative methods, including the River of Life (ROL) and Community Forums (CF), were employed to elevate diverse community voices, particularly from underserved rural, border, and minoritized populations. Key priorities identified included improving access to mental health care, addressing childcare shortages, expanding transportation and healthcare access, and strengthening culturally and linguistically appropriate services. The ROL approach revealed 8 social drivers of health, while CFs highlighted actionable solutions rooted in lived experience. Findings underscore the need for upstream policy investments and community-informed strategies to reduce maternal health disparities and improve statewide MCH outcomes. This participatory process demonstrates the value of engaging historically marginalized communities in shaping programs and policies that directly impact their health and well-being.</p>

<h2 id="article-60">60. Psychometric properties of the Occupational Balance Questionnaire 11-Chinese version.</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: Scandinavian journal of occupational therapy

<h3 id="摘要-59">摘要</h3>
<p>Occupational balance (OB) is a subjective feeling of having the right amount and variety of occupations.
The study aims to translate the Occupational Balance Questionnaire (OBQ11) into Chinese (OBQ11-C) and to examine its psychometric properties for people with depression in Taiwan.
The OBQ11 was translated and reviewed by 10 experts. Subjects with depression were referred from two psychiatric outpatient clinic in central Taiwan. Cognitive debriefing involved 10 subjects, while 161 subjects (average age = 39.2 ± 14.0, 66.5% female) were assessed for reliability and validity using classical test theory by PASW 20.0 and Rasch analysis by Winsteps 5.3.0.
The OBQ11-C showed good content validity, internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.90), item-total correlation (0.49-0.77) and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.90). Rasch analysis results supported the four-point Likert scale, unidimensionality, item separation (3.95), item reliability (0.94), person separation (2.87) and person reliability (0.89), and may have cultural and population differences compared with other language versions.
The OBQ11-C is a valid tool for assessing OB in Chinese-speaking individuals, particularly those with depression in Taiwan.
This study validates a tool designed to assess OB as a foundation for creating individualised, occupation-based programmes for individuals with depression.</p>
