<h2 id="article-1">1. Cortical Gray Matter Proteins Associated With Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy in Community-Dwelling Older Adults: An Autopsy Study.</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: Neurology
<strong>发表日期</strong>: 2025-Sep-23
<strong>链接</strong>: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40845264">PubMed</a></p>

<h3 id="摘要">摘要</h3>
<p>Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is the accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) in the walls of small vessels in the leptomeninges and cortex and is a risk factor of intracerebral hemorrhage and dementia, but its underlying mechanism is unknown. We examined cortical proteins in relation to CAA to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying CAA.
Data were collected from participants of 5 community-based cohorts of older adults. Participants were recruited from personal dwellings or retirement centers, were without known dementia at enrollment, and signed an Anatomic Gift Act for brain donation. At death, autopsy was performed and cortical proteins were quantified from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex using mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis, and pathologic indices of brain pathologies including CAA and Alzheimer disease (AD) were assessed during neuropathologic evaluations. Targeted mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis was performed for the quantification of total Aβ protein and Aβ38 peptide. Ordinal logistic regression models were used to test the association between the proteins and CAA.
A total of 887 participants were included, with a mean age at death of 89.0 (SD = 6.8) years, and 67.2% (n = 596) were women. Eighty proteins were related to CAA, of which 12 remained associated with CAA after controlling for AD pathology. However, only 4 proteins remained associated with CAA when all 12 proteins were examined in a single model: secreted modular calcium-binding protein 1 (SMOC1), secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1), APOE, and APOE4. Examining the 4 proteins together with the 3 Aβ measures (Aβ load, total Aβ protein, and Aβ38 peptide) in a factor analysis and a structure equation model suggested 2 factors and paths: a factor including Aβ38, SFRP1, and APOE protein, which had the larger effect size in relation to CAA (standardized estimate = 0.459, SE = 0.050, p &lt; 0.001), and a second factor including Aβ load, total Aβ protein, SMOC1, and APOE4 that had a smaller effect size in relation to CAA (standardized estimate = 0.253, SE = 0.083, p &lt; 0.001).
This study suggests 2 molecular pathways underlying CAA, with a larger effect size for the pathway including SFRP1 and APOE protein and C-terminally truncated Aβ before position 40. However, the study is an observational cross-sectional study that limits causal inference from the findings.</p>

<h2 id="article-2">2. Teaching Critical Thinking in the Age of AI: Safeguarding Clinical Reasoning in Healthcare Documentation.</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: International nursing review
<strong>发表日期</strong>: 2025-Sep
<strong>链接</strong>: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40845221">PubMed</a></p>

<h3 id="摘要-1">摘要</h3>
<p>To examine the implications of large language models (LLMs) in clinical documentation and explore strategies to preserve critical thinking among healthcare professionals in the age of artificial intelligence (AI).
AI-powered documentation tools, particularly those using LLMs, are being rapidly adopted in healthcare to reduce administrative burden and enhance efficiency. However, concerns are emerging about their potential to undermine clinical reasoning, individualized care, and provider well-being.
While AI offers substantial benefits, its overuse risks promoting automation complacency, exacerbating note bloat, and diminishing clinicians’ critical thinking. Clinical documentation reflects a cognitive process central to diagnosis and care planning. Safeguarding this process requires targeted education in AI literacy, active verification of AI outputs, and deliberate training in reflective practice and clinical reasoning.
AI must be integrated into clinical workflows with caution and transparency. Education and governance structures must prioritize critical thinking, accuracy, and ethical practice in documentation.
Nurses must develop AI literacy and maintain active engagement in documentation to preserve high standards of care. Policymakers should mandate AI evaluation frameworks that include clinician cognitive load and safety, and embed AI and critical thinking education into all levels of health professional training.</p>

<h2 id="article-3">3. Validity and Reliability of the New Innovation Culture Scale© for Use in Healthcare Settings.</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: The Journal of nursing administration

<h3 id="摘要-2">摘要</h3>
<p>To assess the psychometric properties of the new 10-item Innovation Culture Scale©.
American healthcare is expensive with poor health outcomes as the norm. Nurses can disrupt this paradigm through innovation; however, innovation cannot flourish without a supportive organizational culture. There is a lack of scales to measure innovation culture within healthcare settings, thus supporting improvements in quality of care.
A Northeastern health system provided a convenience sample of 5658 nurses, physicians, and allied health professionals. Scale responses were obtained digitally. Item correlations, scree plot, and confirmatory factory analysis examined the scale’s internal structure and assessed model fit.
Two hundred sixteen participants completed the scale. Item correlations were positive and significant (P &lt; 0.001). Scree plot confirmed a single factor structure. Several indices supported an acceptable model fit (comparative fit index = 0.935, Tucker-Lewis index = 0.916, standardized root mean square residual = 0.05), although root mean square error of approximation (0.119) was poor. Cronbach’s α was 0.94.
The Innovation Culture Scale is a valid and reliable measure to assess innovation culture in healthcare settings.</p>

<h2 id="article-4">4. Engaging Nursing Students in Community Partnerships: Development of a Health Promotion Program.</h2>
<p><strong>期刊</strong>: The Journal of nursing education
<strong>发表日期</strong>: 2025-Aug-25
<strong>链接</strong>: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40844739">PubMed</a></p>

<h3 id="摘要-3">摘要</h3>
<p>Experiential learning experiences addressing the needs of underserved populations have been recognized by the National League of Nursing as an important component of nursing education. Engaging students in academic experiences involving community partnerships enhances interprofessional and leadership skills to address social determinants of health (SDOH).
Undergraduate community health nursing students participated in the development of a youth health promotion program in an underserved community with a primarily Hispanic population. Students engaged in program development, implementation, community partner collaboration, and outcomes evaluation.
Students reported the health promotion program provided them a unique experience helping an underserved community with limited resources. Students further noted the importance of culturally congruent interventions that are tailored to the population being served.
Engaging nursing students in academic partner collaborations addressing SDOH is an important step in preparing students to lead, develop, and implement community health interventions in their future practice.</p>

<strong>链接</strong>: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40845311">PubMed</a></p>

<h3 id="摘要-4">摘要</h3>
<p>To assess the concurrent validity of 2 wearable sensors, GENEActiv (GA) and MonBaby (MB), for tracking tummy time in full-term and preterm infants at home.
Nineteen full-term infants and 13 infants born preterm, aged 3 to 6 months, wore GA and MB sensors during caregivervideo-recorded active play at home over 3 days. Prone (tummy time) durations detected by each sensor were compared to video for validation.
Both GA and MB sensors demonstrated excellent (κ = 0.86) and substantial (κ = 0.78) second-by-second agreement with video, respectively, for tracking tummy time. For cumulative tummy time, the GA showed higher accuracy with video (GA =60 minutes, video =58 minutes, difference =2 minutes) compared to MB (MB =43 minutes, video =47 minutes, difference =4 minutes). No differences in accuracy were found between the 2 sensors.
Wearable sensors can accurately track tummy time at home and can support adherence to movement guidelines in infants. Establishing caregiver feasibility is crucial for broader use.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-6">摘要</h3>
<p>Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a frequent occurrence in patients with cancer. However, it is not known whether treatment with different classes of anticoagulants impacts the risk of subsequent arterial thromboembolism (ATE). We performed a retrospective, population-based cohort study using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data linked with Medicare claims. Patients were eligible for study inclusion if they had a diagnosis of primary brain, colorectal, gastric, pancreatic, lung, or ovarian cancer between 2007 and 2015, were diagnosed with VTE, and had a prescription claim for a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC), low-molecular-weight heparin (LWMH), or warfarin. We propensity score matched patients 1:1:1 into anticoagulant treatment groups based on baseline demographic information, cancer-specific characteristics, and cardiovascular comorbidities. The primary aim of the study was to determine and compare the 6-month cumulative incidence of ischemic stroke across anticoagulant classes. The study comprised of 4,875 total patients with 1,625 in each treatment group. At 6-months, the cumulative incidence of ischemic stroke was 5.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.0 - 6.3) overall and 6.8% (95% CI 5.6 - 8.1) in DOAC, 4.9% (95% CI 3.9 - 6.0) in LMWH, and 5.2% (95% CI 4.1 - 6.2) in warfarin treatment groups (p = 0.040). We identified hypertension (odds ratio [OR] 1.75), atrial fibrillation/flutter (OR 1.37), DOAC use (OR 1.36), and prior stroke (OR 3.59) as statistically significant risk factors for ischemic stroke on multivariable modeling. In conclusion, ischemic stroke is a common occurrence after cancer-associated VTE and may occur more frequently in patients treated with DOACs.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-7">摘要</h3>
<p>Patients with serious and persistent mental illness may experience intractable suffering despite exhaustive treatment, challenging the dominant curative paradigm in psychiatry. Palliative psychiatry offers an emerging alternative-prioritizing comfort, dignity, and quality of life when remission is no longer attainable. This article presents a comprehensive ethical and clinical framework for integrating palliative psychiatry into psychiatric-mental health nurse practitioner (PMHNP) practice. Drawing parallels with somatic palliative care, the author explores the theoretical foundations, diagnostic complexities, and ethical imperatives guiding palliative psychiatry. The article delineates PMHNP competencies in prognostic assessment, symptom management, advance-care planning, and interprofessional collaboration. Legal challenges, such as hospice eligibility criteria and involuntary treatment statutes, are also examined, with recommendations for practice and policy reform. Through this synthesis, the author argues that PMHNPs are ideally positioned to lead a paradigm shift that upholds the humanity of patients at the limits of recovery.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-8">摘要</h3>
<p>Tobacco and cannabis are among the most widely used substances globally, and rates of co-use are on the rise. Understanding the impact of inhaled tobacco-cannabis co-use on health outcomes and tobacco cessation is critical for guiding patients and clinicians.
To summarize the existing evidence, identify knowledge gaps, and prioritize research questions related to effects of inhaled tobacco-cannabis co-use on tobacco cessation and lung health.
A multidisciplinary committee was convened to review the evidence, identify knowledge gaps, and develop research questions in four priority research areas: 1) common data elements and terminology; 2) patterns and prevalence of co-use; 3) impact of co-use on tobacco cessation; and 4) effects of co-use on lung health. A modified Delphi process was conducted in three rounds to reach consensus on prioritizing research questions.
The evidence reviewed by the expert panel in four priority research areas yielded the following gaps in the literature with high priority to address with future research: 1) lack of consensus on terminology and recommended co-use data elements; 2) limited research on co-use and tobacco-related disparities; 3) insufficient evidence on how cannabis use affects tobacco cessation; and 4) alarming yet inconsistent findings on the effects of co-use on lung health.
This statement outlines and guides a research agenda on the effects of inhaled tobacco-cannabis co-use on tobacco cessation and lung health. Consensus-driven recommendations include adopting harmonized terms and minimum data elements; studying the prevalence of co-use among populations experiencing tobacco-related disparities; evaluating the impact of co-use on tobacco cessation pharmacotherapies; and assessing the effects of co-use on the development and progression of lung diseases.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-9">摘要</h3>
<p>Hospice and palliative care nurses initiate goals of care conversations with patients and family members while advocating for the completion of advance directives. As leaders in these conversations, nurses must have a working knowledge of the various forms, such as portable medical orders. The National Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) Paradigm calls for the standardization of portable medical orders to ensure goal-concordant care that can cross all healthcare settings. This rapid review provides an overview of state-level portable medical order forms, compares and contrasts them with the National POLST form, and proposes policy recommendations for hospice and palliative care nurses to advocate within their state, territory, or tribal nation. Portable medical order forms were obtained from governmental websites, and data were extracted systematically, with the National POLST form serving as the template. Only 5 states use the National POLST form, and the other 46 demonstrate wide variations in form structure, sequence of orders, and level of specificity for treatment options. No portable medical orders were identified for US territories and tribal nations. Hospice and palliative care nurses can utilize the results of this rapid review to advocate for legislative changes, such as reordering treatment options, integrating rather than always starting with high-intensity care.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-10">摘要</h3>
<p>Chemicals provide numerous benefits that support and improve the health and welfare of humans and the environment in a wide range of applications. The environmental release of chemicals, however, can result in risks to humans and the environment. Minimizing and eliminating chemical pollution should thus represent an important goal for all stakeholders and rights holders. Recognizing the global concerns associated with chemical pollution, in 2022 the United Nations Environmental Assembly 5.2. approved the adoption of resolution 5/8, declaring that a science-policy panel should be established to contribute further to the sound management of chemicals and waste, and to prevent pollution. Three years later, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Panel for Chemicals, Waste and Pollution (ISPCWP) was established on the 20th June 2025 at an Intergovernmental Meeting in Punta de Este, Uruguay. A globally harmonized approach and collective international effort can maximize the value of existing national efforts, overcome regional disadvantages related to socioeconomic and geopolitical factors, and fast-track international responses to emerging and legacy chemicals and waste issues. The mission of the ISPCWP will only be achieved with multi-stakeholder and rights owner engagement, a robust scientific foundation, and the sound implementation of policies. A conceptual framework is presented that supports a risk-based prioritization of issues and actions for environmental and human health protection. It is proposed that the conceptual framework provides a tool that can be adopted to support science-based prioritization, and which can facilitate transparency with respect to the decision-making process of the ISPCWP’s work programme.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-11">摘要</h3>
<p>Emergency department (ED) “boarding” for behavioral health occurs when patients remain in emergency rooms overnight due to a lack of available psychiatric beds. However, quantification of the problem and demographic characterization of affected populations have been limited and manual. When a patient stays in the ED awaiting either an inpatient psychiatric bed or community care, this is known as a behavioral health hold (BHH). Understanding of BHH requires statewide, ‘real-time’ data collection that does not widely exist.
Collaborators leveraged an existing syndromic surveillance system to compile ED data from across North Carolina into an executive BHH dashboard by developing a custom data extract, implementing a BHH case definition, and curating the data in a secure environment. Data come from 131 hospitals submitting ED visit data to NC DETECT, and the resulting extract includes patients with ED encounters lasting at least 24 hours for a behavioral health reason from November 2022 to November 2024.
The team implemented and evaluated multiple case definitions of BHH based on ICD-10 codes or keywords listed within the free-text encounter chief complaint. One case definition and four metrics were selected for use within a dashboard based on subject matter expert feedback. US Census Bureau data were used to create population denominators and estimate population rates, which are presented in an equity context.
This dashboard enabled data-driven funding and policy decisions for additional crisis stabilization resources, including Facility Based Crisis (FBC) facilities, Behavioral Health Urgent Care (BHUC) facilities, and Mobile Response and Stabilization Services.
A cross-departmental approach provided the necessary expertise for state departments of health to capitalize on an existing syndromic surveillance system to address a behavioral health policy need. This novel approach, encapsulated in a dashboard, places intelligence about the burden of BHH directly in the hands of policy makers.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-13">摘要</h3>
<p>Ginger polysaccharide (GP) was obtained with a yield of 5.18%, and its main fraction GP-F1 (Mw = 109.24 kDa) was purified for structural characterization. Integrated analysis of monosaccharide composition, methylation pattern, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra indicated potential structure configurations of arabinoxylan and arabinogalactan. The amelioration effect on obesity of the GP was evaluated in high-fat diet-induced obese mice. After 8 weeks of supplementation, the GP (500 mg/kg) significantly regulated the body weight gain, white adipose tissue (WAT) expansion, abnormal glucose homeostasis, and hyperlipidemia status of obese mice. Notably, GP treatment reduced food intake, normalizing energy consumption to levels comparable to those of control groups. This correlated with decreased leptin concentrations in serum and WAT, indicating amelioration of leptin resistance, which related to appetite regulation. The expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 in the hypothalamus was downregulated, thereby benefiting the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and leptin sensitivity. In addition, GP activated thermogenic pathways in brown adipose tissue, evidenced by upregulated expression of UCP1, PGC-1α, and PRDM16, thereby enhancing energy expenditure. Collectively, GP supplementation alleviated HFD-induced obesity by appetite suppression and energy expenditure promotion.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-14">摘要</h3>
<p>One of the major challenges in modern biogerontology is understanding the accumulation of molecular damage and the manifestation of phenotypic heterogeneity during aging. Notably, genomic instability caused by impaired DNA damage repair along with telomere attrition are primary drivers of aging. However, how these aging-related characteristics differ in individuals who age healthily without developing major age-associated diseases remains unclear. Here, whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on 100 healthy agers (≥ 60 years old, no age-related diseases) and 100 unhealthy agers (≥ 60 years old, at least one age-related disease/condition) based on a case-control study. Telomere length was measured using TelSeq and Computel. High-functional impact germline variant (gHFI) burden and alteration pattern at the pathway level were also analyzed. The GTEx dataset including 751 individuals was used to observe the functional impact of identified germline variants at the molecular level. Telomere length showed minimal differences before 65 years of age but declined rapidly in unhealthy agers beyond this age. Additionally, healthy agers had lower gHFI burden, particularly in DNA repair genes such as BLM. Pathway analysis revealed enrichment of oxidative stress-related mutations in healthy agers, correlated with reduced oxidative stress and upregulated antioxidant enzymes (SOD1 and SOD2). Overall, genomic instability preserved through slow telomere attrition and reduced DNA repair defects plays a key role in healthy aging. Improved oxidative stress resistance may contribute to healthier aging, highlighting the role of genetic factors in reducing age-related decline and supporting overall well-being in later life.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-15">摘要</h3>
<p>Assess the feasibility and effect of Enhanced Barrier Precautions (EBP) on the transmission of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and carbapenem-resistant organisms (CRO) among residents in nursing home chronic ventilator units (NH-CVU).
Pre-post interventional study.
Two community-based nursing homes with CVUs in Maryland. A total of 56 residents were enrolled in the baseline period and 64 residents were enrolled in the intervention period.
During a 3-month baseline and intervention period, residents were swabbed monthly to estimate SA and CRO acquisition. During a 2-month training period, EBP was implemented for residents with chronic wounds, medical devices, or history of multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) colonization. During the subsequent 3-month intervention period, healthcare personnel (HCP) wore gowns and gloves for high-contact care activities when residents were on EBP. Whole genome sequencing assessed resident-to-resident transmission.
At baseline, NH-CVU1 used gowns and gloves for all direct contact, while NH-CVU2 used EBP only for residents with a history of MDRO colonization. After training, the proportion of NH-CVU2 residents on EBP increased from 65% in the baseline period to 87% in the intervention period. Glove use was high (93-98%) in both NH-CVUs. Gown use increased from 39% to 77% in NH-CVU1 and from 26% to 72% in NH-CVU2. Resident-to-resident transmission of SA or CRO decreased by 25% in NH-CVU1 (p = 0.60) and by 67% in NH-CVU2 (p = 0.05). CRO transmission decreased by 33% in NH-CVU1 (p = 0.54) and by 83% in NH-CVU2 (p = 0.02).
EBP is feasible and potentially decreases overall and CRO transmission in nursing home CVUs.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-16">摘要</h3>
<p>Injury and overdose are leading causes of adolescent death in the United States, with high rates of problematic substance use among injured adolescents. We sought to determine whether drug screening prevalence and positivity at pediatric trauma centers have changed with the ongoing adolescent overdose crisis.
This study evaluated trends in biochemical drug screening prevalence and positivity among injured adolescents (12-17 years) from the 2017-2022 Trauma Quality Improvement Program dataset. These were compared with contemporaneous trends in national adolescent overdose deaths from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Trends were assessed with linear and logistic regression. We evaluated the association of clinical characteristics with drug positivity using multivariable logistic regression.
Across 125,745 adolescents treated at 134 pediatric trauma centers, 21.5% (n=27,232) received a biochemical drug screen. From 2017-2022, screening rates declined from 22.9% to 21.0% (p&lt;0.001). Contemporaneously, among 25 million US adolescents, the incidence of drug overdose death increased from 1.0 deaths/100,000 adolescents to 2.8 deaths/100,000 (p=0.004).Screened adolescents (n=27,232) most often tested positive for cannabis (28.8%; n=7,857), opioids (4.5%; n=1,228), benzodiazepines (4.5%; n=1,217), meth/amphetamine (2.0%; n=545), and cocaine (1.6%; n=434). Increasing age was associated with drug positivity for all substances, including opioids (OR=1.06; 95%CI=1.02-1.10; p=0.004) and meth/amphetamine (OR=1.31; 95%CI=1.22-1.39; p&lt;0.001). This correlated with national overdose deaths which increased from 0.3 deaths/100,000 12-year-olds to 4.6 deaths/100,000 17-year-olds (p=0.004).
Despite increasing overdose deaths, drug screening at pediatric trauma centers is decreasing. Expanded trauma center drug screening may identify problematic substance use, preventing future overdose deaths.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-17">摘要</h3>
<p>Post-translational modifications (PTMs) provide essential fine-tuning of protein functions in response to environmental changes. Among the PTMs, lysine acetylation (Kac) and the recently identified lysine lactylation (Kla) play crucial roles in metabolic regulation considering that lactate and acetyl-CoA (Ac-CoA) are generated from pyruvate as the outlet of glycolysis. However, their crosstalk and regulatory mechanisms remain largely unknown, particularly in prokaryotes. Herein, we investigated the intricate interrelation between Kla and Kac in the cariogenic bacterium Streptococcus mutans, a prolific producer of lactate. We conducted a comprehensive profiling of Kla and Kac, observing their wide distribution in glycolytic enzymes. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), the terminal enzyme of glycolysis, exhibited dynamic Kla and Kac shifts in line with glycolytic intermediates, where the ratio of Kla to Kac denotes the metabolic influx. Furthermore, ActA was pinpointed as a dual-function acyltransferase catalyzing the Kla and Kac of LDH, both negatively regulating its enzymatic activity. Importantly, the study identifies lysine 307 (K307) on LDH as a critical site, with its acylation significantly altering LDH activity, thereby lactate production and bacterial growth. Our insights into the metabolic regulation mediated by Kla and Kac contribute to the understanding of the metabolism-PTM-metabolism feedback loop, allowing bacteria to fine-tune their metabolism based on the availability of metabolic intermediates.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-18">摘要</h3>
<p>An effective prophylactic HIV vaccine will likely need to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). bnAbs to the Apex region of the HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env) are promising targets for vaccination because of their relatively low somatic hypermutation compared with other bnAbs. Most Apex bnAbs engage Env using an exceptionally long heavy-chain complementarity-determining region 3 (HCDR3) containing specific binding motifs, which reduces bnAb precursor frequency and makes priming of rare bnAb precursors a likely limiting step in the path to Apex bnAb induction. We found that adjuvanted protein or mRNA lipid nanoparticle (LNP) immunization of rhesus macaques with ApexGT6, an Env trimer engineered to bind Apex bnAb precursors, consistently induced Apex bnAb-related precursors with long HCDR3s bearing bnAb-like sequence motifs. Cryo-electron microscopy revealed that elicited Apex bnAb-related HCDR3s had structures combining elements of several prototype Apex bnAbs. These results achieve a critical HIV vaccine development milestone in outbred primates.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-19">摘要</h3>
<p>Metabolic enzymes, critical for cellular homeostasis, are frequently co-opted in a disease-specific manner to drive cancer progression. Here, we identify aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10 (AKR1B10), down-regulated in gastrointestinal cancers, as a pivotal metastasis suppressor correlating with improved colorectal cancer (CRC) prognosis. Mechanistically, AKR1B10 activates protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) by preventing redox-regulated nitration of its B56α subunit, preserving holoenzyme assembly and enabling c-Myc dephosphorylation at serine-62. Loss of AKR1B10 disrupts this pathway, stabilizing c-Myc, which drives integrin signaling and metastatic dissemination in CRC. We further demonstrate that lysine-125 of AKR1B10 is essential for its interaction with PP2A-Cα and B56α nitration, thereby attenuating CRC metastatic aggressiveness. Pharmacological restoration of PP2A activity effectively mitigates metastasis associated with AKR1B10 loss. In addition, c-Myc transcriptionally represses AKR1B10, establishing a feedback loop that sustains its down-regulation and enhances metastatic progression. This study uncovers an antimetastatic mechanism involving AKR1B10-mediated PP2A activation and highlights its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-20">摘要</h3>
<p>Craniosynostosis is a common birth defect affecting 1 of the 2200 live births causing severe skull and cognitive defects, due to premature cranial suture fusion. The current surgical treatments require invasive calvaria vault remodeling and cranial bone resection in the baby. We demonstrate that inhibition of miR-200a in PMIS-miR-200a mice results in coronal suture fusion (craniosynostosis). Therefore, we use overexpression of miR-200a to prevent suture fusion in Twist1 mutant mice, a well-known model for craniosynostosis. We developed a PEGylated-peptide nanoparticle system to deliver plasmid DNA expressing miR-200a directly to the sutures of postnatal day 4 (P4) Twist1 mutant mice before suture fusion. Injection of the miR-200a nanoparticles under the scalp before suture fusion at P7 to P10 inhibited suture fusion. Treatments increased Gli1- and Six2-positive suture stem cells and the thickness of the periosteum layer. The treated Twist1+/- mice increased body weight and were alert and active. We demonstrate an effective noninvasive gene therapy treatment for craniosynostosis.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-21">摘要</h3>
<p>Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) play critical roles in innate immunity, epithelial barrier protection, and tissue homeostasis. However, the maintenance machinery of intestinal tissue residency of ILCs remains elusive. Here, we show that gut microbiota is necessary for the maintenance of intestinal tissue residency of ILCs. Microbiota metabolite taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA) binds to P2Y10 receptor on ILCs to initiate downstream Ca2+ and RhoA signaling pathways. TDCA-P2Y10 engagement induces Zfp414 transcription to prime expression of CD69 and integrin αE on ILCs, leading to intestinal residency of ILCs. Moreover, decreased levels of TDCA or P2Y10 deficiency abrogates the intestinal residency of ILCs, resulting in severer intestinal inflammation. Of note, TDCA administration can enhance intestinal tissue residency of ILCs and promote protection against intestinal inflammation. Thus, TDCA might be used as a potential drug to treat patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-22">摘要</h3>
<p>As substitutes for traditional organophosphate esters (tOPEs), the safety of emerging aryl-OPEs (aryl-eOPEs) requires further evaluation. Understanding their fates in organisms is crucial for assessing potential toxicity and health risks. This study quantitatively investigated the toxicokinetics of four aryl-eOPEs and compared them with tOPEs in Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 72) over a 20-day gavage exposure followed by a 9-day elimination period. The absorption rates of aryl-eOPEs (8.95-28.0%) were approximately 1/2 to 1/10 those of tOPEs (61.9-96.8%), with hydrophobicity and molecular weight being key impact factors. The total concentration of aryl-eOPEs in feces was nearly double that of tOPEs, yet only 6.86-23.6% resulted from metabolic clearance in rats. Most administered aryl-eOPEs were not absorbed by the body and were directly excreted via feces. However, the half-lives of aryl-eOPEs in rats were generally longer than those of tOPEs, with bisphenol A bis(diphenyl phosphate) exhibiting the longest half-life (2.68-6.59 days), highlighting their potential health risks. Additionally, significant pulmonary accumulation of aryl-eOPEs was observed, with the liver, kidneys, and small intestines playing key roles in metabolism and clearance. This study elucidates the toxicokinetic behavior of aryl-eOPEs in mammals and highlights the influence of their physicochemical properties. These findings provide a scientific foundation for assessing their potential health effects.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-24">摘要</h3>
<p>To review the association between hysterectomy, with and without oophorectomy, and fracture, osteoporosis, and bone mineral density (BMD) change.
We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis, searching PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central, and CINAHL from inception to November 2024. Eligible studies included women aged ≥18 years and assessed the relationship between having a hysterectomy and/or oophorectomy and fracture, osteoporosis, or BMD.
Of 15,305 articles screened, 29 met the inclusion criteria, with 19 included in the meta-analyses. Bilateral oophorectomy compared to no oophorectomy was associated with a higher risk of fracture (pooled relative risk [RR] 1.17, 95% CI 1.03-1.33, 10 studies) and osteoporosis, although the latter was not statistically significant (RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.94-2.27, four studies). Hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy was not associated with a higher fracture risk compared to hysterectomy without oophorectomy (RR 0.99; 95% CI 0.83-1.18, four studies). However, hysterectomy without oophorectomy compared to no surgery was associated with a higher osteoporosis risk (RR 1.45; 95% CI 1.37-1.53, two studies). Findings showed moderate to high heterogeneity, and most studies did not account for variables such as age at surgery, menopausal hormone therapy use, and indications for surgery.
Our review supports evidence showing that bilateral oophorectomy is negatively associated with bone health and suggests that hysterectomy alone may also increase osteoporosis risk, although more data are required. To support personalised clinical decision-making, further large-scale longitudinal studies with longer follow-up and detailed assessment of surgery extent, timing, and medication use are essential.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-25">摘要</h3>
<p>Leptospirosis, caused by pathogenic Leptospira spp., is one of the most widespread zoonotic diseases globally. In 2014, leptospirosis was reinstated as a nationally notifiable condition due to evidence of increasing incidence and public health importance. We describe the epidemiological, temporal, and geographic trends of leptospirosis in the United States since reinstatement.
Analysis included confirmed and probable leptospirosis cases from jurisdictions reporting ≥ 1 case between 2014-2020. Analyzed data included reportable case surveillance and voluntarily submitted supplemental data.
Between 2014-2020, CDC received 1,053 case reports from 34 jurisdictions. The national incidence rate was 0.48 cases per 100,000 population. Since 2014, leptospirosis cases have been increasing, with an average annual gain of 13 cases (R2 = 0.69). Cases increased in summer, peaking in early fall, corresponding with warmer weather and hurricane season. Among cases with outcome data, 85% (n = 606/709) were hospitalized and 10% (n = 74) died. Seventy-seven percent of cases (n = 623) reported contact with animals or their bodily fluids while 71% (n = 578) of cases reported contact with freshwater or mud. More cases reported avocational activities (n = 413, [52%]) as the source of their animal or environmental exposure(s) than recreational or occupational activities (n = 203, [25%] vs n = 163, [20%], respectively). Only 13% of cases reported any international travel in the 30 days prior to symptom onset.
An increasing number of leptospirosis cases in the U.S. are being reported, mostly from domestic sources of infection. Changing epidemiological trends away from occupational exposures to avocational or recreational activities highlights the need for interventions mitigating these exposure risks. A high percentage of cases were hospitalized and died emphasizing the need to educate healthcare providers, public health professionals, and the public about early identification and treatment for leptospirosis to improve patient outcomes.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-26">摘要</h3>
<p>Emerging evidence suggests that low-dose ionizing radiation increases the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. Past studies have relied on death data to identify dementia, and these are prone to under-ascertainment and complicate the estimation of health risks as individuals tend to live with dementia for many years following onset. We present findings from the first occupational cohort to investigate dementia risk from low-dose radiation using incident outcomes.
This is a retrospective cohort of 60 874 Ontario Nuclear Power Plant workers from the Canadian National Dose Registry. Personal identifiers were linked to Ontario population-based administrative health data. Incident dementias between 1996 and 2022 were identified using a validated algorithm based on physician, hospital, and prescription drug data. Individual-level annual estimates of whole-body external ionizing radiation were derived from personal workplace monitoring. The incidence of dementia among these workers was compared to a random sample of Ontario residents matched by sex, age, and residential area. Internal cohort analysis using Poisson and linear excess relative risk (ERR) models, adjusted for sex, attained age, calendar period, and neighborhood income quintile, were used to characterize the shape of the exposure-response curve between low-dose cumulative radiation (lagged 10 years) and incident dementia.
There were 476 incident dementias and 867 028 person-years of follow-up. The mean whole-body lifetime accumulated exposure at the end of follow-up was 11.7 millisieverts (mSv). Workers with cumulative exposure between 50-100 mSv had an increased risk of dementia [RR 1.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99-2.28] compared to those unexposed. Spline analysis suggested that the dose-response relationship was non-linear. The linear ERR per 100 mSv increase in exposure was 0.704 (95% CI 0.018-1.390).
Our findings suggest that low-dose exposure to ionizing radiation increases the risk of incident dementia.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-27">摘要</h3>
<p>Severe trauma continues to pose a substantial burden on survivors, particularly in terms of long-term physical, psychological, and social functioning. While survival rates have improved, data on long-term outcomes remain limited. This study evaluates ten-year post-injury outcomes in patients with major trauma, focusing on return to work and social participation.
In this single-center, retrospective cohort study, adult patients (≥ 18 years) with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) ≥ 9 treated between 2010 and 2013 were surveyed and distributed minimally 10 years later. Patients completed standardized questionnaires assessing sociodemographic and occupational data, functional status, and psychological well-being using the Trauma Outcome Profile (TOP).
Ninety-one patients completed the follow-up. The mean age at injury was 43.0 years, with a mean ISS of 20.8. Ten years post-trauma, 82.4% of patients had returned to work; 10.6% required vocational retraining, and 25.3% changed occupations. Failure to return to work was significantly associated with higher ISS (p = 0.027), increased anxiety (p = 0.005), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD, p = 0.039), and reduced mental functioning (p = 0.009), but not with physical functioning ten years after the trauma. Patients with mental health impairments were more likely to experience reduced independence, impaired social participation, and difficulties in activities of daily living.
A majority of patients successfully reintegrated into the workforce ten years after trauma. Mental health, rather than physical disability, emerged as the primary determinant of long-term occupational reintegration. These findings underscore the necessity for comprehensive, long-term rehabilitation programs that prioritize psychosocial support.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-28">摘要</h3>
<p>With frequent new variants of SARS-CoV-2 and vaccine coverage below 50 % in low-income countries, COVID-19 remains a global health challenge, underscoring the need to update evidence-based health strategies and to understand the pandemic from a historical standpoint. Brazil is an important model for study because of the initial widespread infection and subsequent high population adherence to vaccination.
To compare severity outcomes in a setting of initial low vaccination and after mass vaccination (&gt; 95 %) according to COVID-19 test positivity.
A prospective study with 673 patients tested for COVID-19, followed up until final outcome, in an isolation unit in southern Brazil. We compare the main outcomes and symptoms between the three epidemic waves in Brazil.
The vaccination coverage was 0.4 %, 35.0 %, and 97.6 % during the three waves, while severe cases decreased significantly from the first to the third. Black and brown ethnicity were more frequent among cases during the second wave, and lower income was associated with the second and third. In the multivariate analysis, higher heart rate and black and brown ethnicity were new factors associated with positive diagnosis and severity independently of period.
As vaccination progressed, ethnicity and lower income emerged as increasingly important risk factors, uncovering complex relationships between vaccine coverage and access to information in Brazil. The present results offer a broad view of the clinical features of COVID-19 over almost the entire pandemic period and can help evaluate public policies for subsequent management decisions and strategies to reduce health inequities.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-29">摘要</h3>
<p>Triglycerides and T cells play a key role in atherosclerosis, the leading cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Moderately elevated triglycerides have emerged as a causal risk factor, and T cells are a prominent component of atherosclerotic plaques. This cross-sectional study examined transcriptomic differences in T cells among patients with varying triglyceride levels via RNA sequencing. We analyzed CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from 49 participants, including those with primary (genetic) and secondary moderate hypertriglyceridemia, severe hypertriglyceridemia, and hypotriglyceridemia. Patients with primary moderate hypertriglyceridemia exhibited a proinflammatory transcriptomic profile, including increased interleukin-6 receptor (IL6R) expression, which is implicated in CVD risk. Similar patterns appeared in CD8+ T cells and, to a lesser extent, in secondary moderate hypertriglyceridemia patients. Conversely, transcriptomic differences were reversed in hypotriglyceridemia and absent in severe hypertriglyceridemia patients. These findings suggest that elevated triglycerides may contribute to CVD by promoting a proinflammatory transcriptomic profile in T cells.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-30">摘要</h3>
<p>p-Phenylenediamine quinones (PPD-Qs), oxidative derivatives of rubber antioxidant p-phenylenediamines (PPDs), have garnered increasing concern due to their environmental ubiquity and toxicity. However, evidence regarding the exposure assessment of these emerging contaminants in humans, especially pregnant women, remains limited. Herein, we measured the levels of six PPD-Qs and their parent six PPDs in 1,278 urine samples collected from 426 pregnant women over three trimesters with the aim of evaluating the exposure profiles, variability, and predictors of PPD-Qs and PPDs during pregnancy. Most PPD-Qs exhibited high detection frequencies (&gt;50 %) in the urine of pregnant women, except for DTPD-Q (9.3 %). The median specific gravity-adjusted concentration of ∑PPD-Qs (10.38 ng/mL) was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.0001) than that of ∑PPDs (1.20 ng/mL). The urinary concentrations of PPD-Qs and PPDs were associated with maternal age, parity, education level, pre-pregnancy body mass index, occupational status, and sampling season. In addition, this longitudinal study found that the PPD-Qs and PPDs concentrations varied across trimesters, with the highest concentrations of most PPD-Qs observed in the first trimester, highlighting a relatively higher exposure risk during early pregnancy. High variability for most PPD-Qs and PPDs highlights the need for multiple measurements to ensure accurate exposure assessment during pregnancy. The median daily excretion of PPD-Qs and PPDs was estimated at 192.54 ng/kg bw/day and 25.18 ng/kg bw/day, respectively, highlighting the urgency of addressing the potential health impacts of these pervasive yet largely ignored contaminants during pregnancy. While this study provides the first longitudinal biomonitoring of PPD-Qs and PPDs during pregnancy, further research integrating longitudinal monitoring with toxicokinetic and epidemiological investigations is essential to better understand the potential health risks associated with these emerging contaminants.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-32">摘要</h3>
<p>Microplastics are ubiquitously present in the atmospheric environment, with a notably high prevalence of fibrous variants that pose significant inhalation risks. Although extensive research has been conducted on the interaction between spherical microplastics and both cellular systems and animal models, the pulmonary toxicity and biological impact of fibrous microplastics remain poorly understood. The comparative toxicological profiles and mechanistic pathways of two morphologically distinct inhalable microplastics - irregular and fibrous structures - were systematically elucidated through integrated multi-level investigations combining in vivo animal exposure systems and in vitro cell culture models. As a result, restricted ventilatory dysfunction and airway remodeling were observed in both irregular microplastics and fibrous microplastics-treated mice. The exposure of microplastics caused epithelial-mesenchymal transition in airway epithelial cells, characterizing in increased migration rate, decreased cell adhesion and cytoskeleton rearrangement. Based on these toxic effects, fibrous microplastic resulted in more severe airway toxicity than irregular variant did. Most importantly, the exposure of fibrous microplastics increased cilia formation and can be reduced by a Piezo1 inhibitor, of which a unique mechanism that is absent with irregular microplastics. In summary, our study demonstrates that microplastic shape not only modulates toxicological potency but may also influence underlying biological mechanisms, highlighting the imperative to incorporate shape-dependent effects into comprehensive health risk assessments of microplastic pollution.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-33">摘要</h3>
<p>Coccidioidomycosis (“Valley fever”) is a fungal disease that causes a wide range of illness severity in animals and people. Here, we use U.S. Census data, surveys of pet ownership demographics, and results of a nation-wide dog serologic study to estimate the financial burden of the disease to dog owners. We estimate that the one-year cost of diagnosis and treatment for uncomplicated pulmonary coccidioidomycosis in dogs across 6 endemic southwestern U.S. states ranged from $60,117,875 to $74,858,713 before adjusting for inflation. The financial burden to dog owners for uncomplicated illness was 9-11 % of discretionary income during the first year of diagnosis and treatment. Adjusting for inflation from 2019 to 2022, the year of our coccidioidomycosis incidence data, the costs increase to $73,944,986 to $92,076,217 annually. In 2025 this increases further to $90,176,812 to $112,288,070. Though there is a lack of specific case numbers of disseminated or complicated coccidioidomycosis, the cost of care for dogs that require emergency care, advanced diagnostics, surgery, and second and third line drugs is higher, putting greater financial strain on dog owners.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-34">摘要</h3>
<p>With the advancement of precision livestock farming (PLF), acoustic technology has emerged as a key tool for tracking the health and well-being of laying hens, owing to its non-invasive, real-time and cost-effective nature. In this study, continuous audio data were collected from commercial chicken houses over a period of 15 days, in addition to temperature and humidity index (THI) analysis, to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model for classifying chicken squawks. This approach enabled the investigation of the relationship between environmental adaptability and acoustic traits in a mixed-sex rearing system. Significant daily variations were observed in the acoustic environment of the chicken house, with rooster crowing behavior corresponding to the highest noise levels (45-50 dB) recorded in the early morning hours. The CNN model achieved 98 % accuracy, along with both macro-average and micro-average scores of 98 %, in classifying roosters, hens, and other sounds, effectively addressing the issue of rooster crowing disturbances in mixed-rearing conditions. Additionally, the model revealed that fundamental frequency shift (F0 Shift) was positively correlated with normal egg production (r = 0.68, p = 0.025), while specific mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC_7, MFCC_10) associated with hen vocalization were significantly negatively correlated with THI ( r = -0.23, p &lt; 0.05; r = -0.37, p &lt; 0.001). These findings highlight the potential of acoustic monitoring as a novel dynamic method for evaluating environmental adaptability and health status in laying hens, reinforcing its utility in precision livestock farming under challenging rearing conditions.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-35">摘要</h3>
<p>To identify and describe the theories, components, and effectiveness of self-management support interventions for socially disadvantaged older adults (≥60 years) with chronic conditions and multimorbidity.
Six electronic databases were searched in November 2023. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) focused on self-management support interventions for socioeconomically disadvantaged community-dwelling older adults with chronic conditions and multimorbidity were included. Data extraction was guided by the Practical Reviews in Self-Management Support taxonomy, and study appraisal used the Revised Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. A critical narrative synthesis was conducted.
Eighteen trials (N = 6269) were included. Interventions varied in their theoretical foundations, components, and delivery methods, showing promise in improving health-related quality of life, mental health, self-management behaviours, and self-efficacy outcomes, while reducing healthcare utilisation. Tailored, multi-component interventions may be effective in improving outcomes for socioeconomically disadvantaged older adults.
Future research should prioritise the development of accessible, culturally appropriate self-management support interventions tailored to disadvantaged populations. These interventions should be evaluated in primary care and community settings for their effectiveness, scalability, and sustainability.
Healthcare providers should integrate multi-component, theory-based support into routine care. Policymakers should create flexible funding and policies to support long-term implementation, addressing health disparities in disadvantaged communities.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-36">摘要</h3>
<p>Minimal research has examined neurochemical alterations underlying the relationship between impulsivity and alcohol use in youth. We examined associations between multimethod impulsivity measures and neurometabolite levels in youth who use alcohol compared to controls.
Using baseline data from two clinical trials with youth (age 16-22) who used alcohol (N = 82, 65 % female) and healthy controls (N = 22, 50 % female), we measured levels of glutamate-related metabolites (glutamate [Glu] and glutamate + glutamine [Glx]) and GABA, and other exploratory neurometabolites (glutathione, total N-acetylaspartate [tNAA], total choline-containing metabolites [tCho], and myo-inositol), in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Trait impulsivity was measured via the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11), and behavioral impulsivity was measured via the D-KEFS Color-Word Interference Test and the Cash Choice Task.
Compared to controls, youth who use alcohol had higher impulsivity on the BIS-11 attentional, non-planning, and motor subscales. There were no significant interactions between group (alcohol, control) and impulsivity variables in predicting Glu, Glx, or GABA levels. In exploratory analyses, better inhibitory control and lower non-planning impulsivity in youth who use alcohol was associated with higher glutathione levels; however, the opposite relationship was found for controls.
These preliminary findings suggest trait, but not behavioral, impulsivity is significantly associated with alcohol use in youth. Glutathione may have differential associations with distinct impulsivity constructs in youth who use alcohol compared to controls. Further research is needed to corroborate these associations and their implications for understanding the neurochemical basis of impulsivity and alcohol use in youth.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-37">摘要</h3>
<p>Fertility preservation (FP) is an important aspect of cancer care for male patients of reproductive age; however, there is a lack of research on male experiences of FP. This scoping review aims to identify barriers and facilitators to FP among male cancer patients, based on both patient and healthcare provider/researcher perspectives.
We conducted a scoping review following the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology and reported results according to the PRISMA-ScR checklist. We searched MEDLINE/PubMed, CINAHL, APA PsycInfo, and Web of Science, with supplemented hand-searching of the ESHRE website and reference lists. We included primary studies published in English (2001-2023) reporting on FP in male cancer patients. Findings were mapped to the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF).
A total of 56 studies met the inclusion criteria. Eleven TDF domains were applicable, with one additional domain, “Patient Characteristics”, added inductively. Among patients, the most frequently coded domains were “Social Influences”, “Goals, Beliefs about Capabilities”, and “Emotion”. For providers/researchers, key domains included “Environmental Context and Resources”, “Patient Characteristics” and “Knowledge”.
A combination of social, psychological, and contextual factors shapes barriers and facilitators to FP in male cancer patients. Addressing these barriers could improve male cancer patients’ quality of life and well-being during treatment and beyond. Recommendations include formalised FP care pathways with an educated, multidisciplinary team, which should be supported by concrete legal and ethical guidelines integrated in policy frameworks concerning cancer care. Applying the TDF can support the development of targeted, evidence-informed strategies to improve FP integration in cancer care.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-38">摘要</h3>
<p>Particulate matter (PM2.5) and allergens are common environmental exposures. However, their combined effects and their risks are still poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the impact of co-exposure to house dust mites (HDM) allergens and diesel exhaust particles (DEP) on lung immune responses, and assess the susceptibility to viral protein. We found that compared with HDM alone, mice co-exposed to HDM and DEP showed DEP-phagocytosed macrophages in lungs and did not show asthma phenotypes, including T helper 2 (Th2) response, eosinophilic inflammation, mucus production, and serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) production. Mechanistically, DEP induced an immunosuppressive state by suppressing HDM-induced Th2 responses by reducing FcγRIIB and FcγRIII-mediated phagocytosis and antigen presentation in the lungs. Notably, short-term exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein subunit 1 (S1) in altered immune environment led to the development of pulmonary fibrosis. This was accompanied by elevated transforming growth factor-β1 expression, increased total IgE levels, and eosinophil infiltration in the lungs. These findings suggest that co-exposure to PM2.5 and allergens causes a vulnerable lung environment that enhances susceptibility to virus-induced lung diseases. Our study emphasizes the need for more comprehensive environmental health assessments that account for the combined risks of PM2.5, allergens, and viral exposures.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-39">摘要</h3>
<p>Noroviruses and enteroviruses are major causes of endemic gastrointestinal disease associated with substantial disease burden. However, viral gastroenteritis is often diagnosed based on symptoms, with etiology infrequently tested or reported, so little information exists on community-level transmission dynamics. In this study, we demonstrate that norovirus (NoV) genogroup II and enterovirus (EV) viral loads in wastewater reveal transmission dynamics of these viruses. We report NoV and EV concentrations in wastewater from 363 samples between December 5 2020 and October 10 2022 (sampled every second day). Virus concentrations in wastewater were low during 2021, and increased in 2022. Wastewater recapitulated periods of increased clinical cases, and also identified silent waves of transmission. We used the measured wastewater loads to estimate the effective reproductive number (Re). The Re for both NoV and EV peaked between 1.1 and 1.2. However, the usual seasonality of NoV transmission was upended by non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to correlated transmission dynamics of NoV GII and EV during 2021-2022. This highlights the use of wastewater to understand transmission dynamics of endemic enteric viruses and estimate relevant epidemiological parameters, including Re.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-40">摘要</h3>
<p>In addition to its nutritional role in regulating calcium and phosphorus metabolism, vitamin D also possesses immunoregulatory effects. Herein, we used chicken embryo fibroblast cells (CEFs) to study the effect of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) on the immune response induced by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infection. We observed the inhibition to virus proliferation in the cells by adding 10 nM 1,25(OH)2D3. In addition, treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 has significantly increased the mRNA expressions of toll-like receptor 15 (TLR15) (2.75-fold), avian beta-defensins 9 (AvBD9) (25.37-fold), and AvBD14 (2.28-fold) in the IBV-infected CEFs comparing with those of the control group. In contrast, the mRNA expression levels of TLR3 (0.98-fold), TLR4 (0.66-fold), TLR5 (0.44-fold), TLR7 (0.62-fold), and AvBD1 (0.57-fold), AvBD3 (0.54-fold), AvBD8 (0.60-fold), and AvBD12 (0.54-fold) were found to be decreased. In parallel with this results, the mRNA expression levels of the myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88) (0.69-fold), interleukin-8 (IL-8) (0.99-fold), IL-6 (0.98-fold), and IL-1β (0.93-fold) in 1,25(OH)2D3 group were also significantly downregulated comparing with those of control group. Thus, the results suggest that adding of 1,25(OH)2D3 is capable of inducing TLRs and AvBDs gene expressions, suppressing the inflammatory response and enhancing an antiviral defense, which might have a beneficial effect in controlling viral infections in poultry.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-41">摘要</h3>
<p>Obesity and sarcopenia are major health concerns, particularly among older populations. Dietary protein may help preserve muscle mass and function, but high-protein diets, especially from animal sources, may also increase adipose mass. We investigated associations of total, animal, and plant protein intake with body composition trajectories, sarcopenia, and sarcopenic obesity.
We included 4576 participants (mean age 65.1 years, 56 % women) from the population-based Rotterdam Study. Dietary protein was measured using food-frequency questionnaires at baseline (2004-2009). Body composition was measured every 4-5 years using dual X-ray-absorptiometry. Handgrip strength (HGS) was assessed starting 2006 using a hydraulic dynamometer. Sarcopenia was determined based on low appendicular skeletal muscle and HGS; and sarcopenic obesity risk based on measures of lean mass, HGS and body fat. Analyses used linear mixed models and generalized estimate equation models.
Higher total protein intake was associated with increased BMI over time (mean difference [95 %-confidence interval (CI)]: 0.86 kg/m2 [0.01,1.71] per 5E% increase), and increased fat-mass index (1.33 [0.67,1.99]), body-fat-percentage (4.54[2.76,6.31]), and both gynoid and android fat percentage. Higher protein intake was also associated with a higher sarcopenic obesity risk (-0.85[-1.5,-0.2]), but with a lower sarcopenia risk (odds ratio: 0.62 [0.43,0.90]). These associations were mainly driven by animal protein.
Higher protein intake, particularly from animal food sources, is protective against sarcopenia but also linked to a higher obesity risk. A balanced protein intake advice for older persons should be formulated based on individual needs and health status to prevent sarcopenia, obesity, and sarcopenic obesity.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-42">摘要</h3>
<p>Providing a variety of elements in the rearing environment may offer a promising way to transition conventional broiler production towards more animal-friendly production systems. This study aimed to investigate the effect of a complex and structured rearing environment on broiler welfare by comparing three complex enriched rooms (E) with visual cues and multiple elements for resting or exploration, to three control rooms (C) with minimal enrichments. Each room housed 2450 Redbro chickens and received natural light. We evaluated how the rearing environment influenced chicken behavior, emotional state, and the cecal microbiota composition at the end of the rearing period. E chickens stood, foraged and moved more often than C chickens (e.g. 38% vs. 19% walking; 4% vs. 1% foraging, P &lt; 0.001), while dustbathing frequency did not differ. In group-based tests, E chickens were more likely to approach and peck at a novel object or human (P &lt; 0.05), suggesting reduced fearfulness and increased curiosity. In the detour test, E chickens exited the U-shaped area more frequently (P &lt; 0.001) and vocalized less (P = 0.004), indicating greater exploratory motivation and possibly better spatial cognition. Microbiota analysis revealed no differences in alpha diversity, but beta diversity differed significantly between treatments (P &lt; 0.001). E chickens had higher relative abundances of Bacteroidota, while C chickens had more Bacillota. Overall, the complex environment promoted natural behaviors, reduced emotional reactivity, and altered gut microbiota composition, supporting its potential to improve broiler welfare under semi-commercial conditions.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-43">摘要</h3>
<p>The Mediterranean Diet (MD) was recently found to have benefits for patients with Crohn’s Disease (CD) in various stages of the disease, though adherence to it may be limited during active disease. We aimed to evaluate the association between adherence to the MD and changes in fecal calprotectin (FC) levels among patients with CD in clinical and biochemical remission.
A prospective cohort of patients with CD in clinical and biochemical remission [Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) &lt; 5 and FC &lt; 250 μg/g]. Patients with FC ≤ 150 μg/g were further categorized as those in deep biochemical remission. The Israeli Mediterranean dietary screener (I-MEDAS) was used to assess adherence to the MD. The median score of the study sample was used as a cut-off for the classification of “adherent” or “non-adherent”.
A total of 96 patients were included in the analysis. Over time, adherence rate to the MD decreased by 25 % among those who were adherent at baseline and increased by 43.8 % among those who were non-adherent at baseline. Patients who were adherent at baseline had higher rates of deep remission at baseline compared with those who were non-adherent at baseline (96.2 % vs. 79.1 % respectively, p = 0.009), and higher rates of remission and deep remission at 3 months (97.5 % vs. 78.6 %, p = 0.011; and 87.5 % vs. 64.3 %, p = 0.023 respectively), but not at 6 months. Throughout follow-up, the change in FC levels was negatively correlated with the change in adherence to low intake of detrimental MD components (r = -0.340, p = 0.006), but not with high intake of beneficial components (p = 0.733).
Adherence to the MD was associated with lower FC levels at baseline and after 3 months. Future studies should examine the long-term effects of MD adherence on the maintenance of clinical and biochemical remission in CD.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-44">摘要</h3>
<p>This study examined how dietary apigenin supplementation influences growth performance, intestinal barrier integrity, and immune response in broilers affected by necrotic enteritis. A total of 144 one-day-old white-feathered broilers were divided into six groups. The NE model groups were inoculated with Eimeria maxima on day 14 and Clostridium perfringens (CP) on days 17-23. With the exception of the NE and NC groups, all other groups received dietary intervention with apigenin from day 24 to day 28. The results demonstrated that NE significantly reduced average daily gain (ADG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR), impaired antioxidant capacity, increased intestinal permeability, elevated anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α), and suppressed intestinal barrier-related gene expression (P &lt; 0.05). Dietary supplementation with 500 mg/kg apigenin effectively mitigated NE-induced damage by enhancing antioxidant activity, modulating immune responses, restoring intestinal morphology, and alleviating inflammatory reactions.</p>

<p>Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) people have significantly higher rates of cardiovascular-related conditions than cisgender people, and Black and Hispanic people have higher rates of cardiovascular-related conditions than non-Hispanic White people. However, little is known about the prevalence of cardiovascular-related conditions among racial and ethnic subgroups of TGD people.
To compare the prevalence of cardiovascular-related conditions across racial and ethnic groups for TGD and cisgender people using quantitative intersectional methods.
Medicare enrollment and claims data were used from TGD and cisgender beneficiaries from 2011 to 2020. Using an established algorithm, likely TGD people were identified based on their diagnosis codes and care utilization. The 10 nearest-neighbor cisgender matches for each TGD beneficiary were identified based on propensity scores estimated from the original basis of eligibility, years of enrollment, age, and hospital service area.
Race, ethnicity, and gender modality (TGD and cisgender). These data were analyzed from November 7, 2023, to October 31, 2024.
Rate of cardiovascular-related conditions (peripheral vascular disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) among Asian and Pacific Islander, Black, and Hispanic TGD beneficiaries compared with non-Hispanic White cisgender counterparts using generalized estimating equations, cardiovascular diseases and their risk factors. Attributable proportions for TGD Asian and Pacific Islander, Black, and Hispanic beneficiaries were calculated.
Of the 36 004 TGD beneficiaries, 714 Asian and Pacific Islander (2%), 4518 Black (13%), and Hispanic 2545 (7%) had higher rates of cardiovascular-related conditions than 28 227 non-Hispanic White (78%) beneficiaries and higher than the 323 613 cisgender beneficiaries (5981 Asian and Pacific Islander [2%]; 40 781 Black [13%]; 22 417 Hispanic [7%]; 254 434 White [79%]). Black TGD beneficiaries had a 74% higher prevalence of peripheral vascular disease, 76% higher prevalence of congestive heart failure, and 50% higher prevalence of diabetes than similar non-Hispanic White cisgender beneficiaries. Overall, 6.3% of the excess peripheral vascular disease among Black TGD beneficiaries and 19.9% of the excess peripheral vascular disease among Asian and Pacific Islander TGD beneficiaries were associated with being at the intersection of gender, race, and ethnicity.
This cross-sectional study found that Asian and Pacific Islander, Black, and Hispanic TGD beneficiaries had a high prevalence of cardiovascular-related conditions and had an elevated prevalence of several conditions, attributable to the intersection of gender, race, and ethnicity. Medicare should use the tools at its disposal to support the health of TGD beneficiaries.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-46">摘要</h3>
<p>This study evaluated the excess risk of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and its association with noise kurtosis (β) among 3421 Chinese male industrial workers exposed to complex noise. The objectives were to: (1) quantify the excess risk of NIHL, (2) examine how kurtosis influences this risk, and (3) recommend occupational exposure limits (OELs) for complex noise. Hearing loss was defined using two metrics: pure-tone averages (PTAs) PTA1234-AI (articulation-index-weighted average at 1-4 kHz) and PTA346 (unweighted average at 3-6 kHz). Logistic regression modeled hearing loss probability based on age, exposure level, and exposure duration. To assess kurtosis-related effects, workers were stratified into three kurtosis-based subgroups. Results showed that complex noise exposures yielded significantly higher excess risk than steady-state noise, and excess risk increased with higher kurtosis. Early noise exposure primarily elevated PTA346-defined hearing loss, with PTA1234-AI-defined hearing loss becoming more prominent as cumulative exposure increased. Derivative analysis of excess risk curves suggests lowering the standard OEL of 85 dBA to 80 dBA for PTA1234-AI and 77 dBA for PTA346. For high-kurtosis exposures (β ≥ 70 for PTA1234-AI; β ≥ 25 for PTA346), an additional 2 dBA reduction is recommended. These findings support more protective OELs for industrial workers exposed to non-steady-state, high-kurtosis noise environments.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-47">摘要</h3>
<p>Poor adherence to prescribed anti-hypertensive treatments remains a significant public health challenge in Nigeria. This study assessed the barriers and enablers of anti-hypertensive medication adherence among hypertensives seeking care in public secondary health facilities in Delta State, Nigeria.
A mixed quantitative and qualitative method was employed to assess the barriers and enablers of anti-hypertensive medication adherence among a random multistage sample of 451 adult hypertensives. Data were collected using an interviewer-administered semi-structured questionnaire and a focus group discussion guide. Descriptive and inferential analyses of the data collected were carried out using the IBM SPSS version 26 software.
The mean age of the study participants was 53.5 (SD = 9.9) years, with 80.7% (n = 364) reporting poor anti-hypertensive medication adherence. Those with good adherence were likely to be at least 50 years old (AOR = 2.625; 95% CI: 1.353 - 4.485; P = 0.014), have tertiary education (AOR = 7.797; 95% CI: 3.359 - 9.758; P = 0.009), belong to the upper socio-economic class (AOR = 2.546; 95% CI: 1.968 - 4.761; P &lt; 0.001) and living with hypertension for at least five years (AOR=1.752; 95% CI: 1.367 - 7.456; P = 0.003).
Anti-hypertensive medication adherence was generally poor among the study participants. There is a need for concerted efforts by health providers to regularly screen for anti-hypertensive adherence and provide qualitative health education targeted at improving adherence to medication among hypertensives.
La mauvaise obser vance des traitements antihypertenseurs prescrits demeure un défi majeur de santé publique au Nigéria. Cette étude a évalué les obstacles et les facteurs facilitateurs de l’observance des médicaments antihypertenseurs chez des patients hypertendus fréquentant des établissements publics de soins secondaires dans l’État du Delta.
Une méthode mixte, quantitative et qualitative, a été utilisée pour évaluer ces éléments auprès d’un échantillon aléatoire multistade de 451 adultes hypertendus. Les données ont été recueillies à l’aide d’un questionnaire semi-structuré administré par un enquêteur et d’un guide de discussion de groupe. Les analyses descriptives et inférentielles ont été réalisées à l’aide du logiciel IBM SPSS version 26.
L’âge moyen des participants était de 53,5 ans (ÉT = 9,9), et 80,7 % (n = 364) ont déclaré une faible observance des médicaments antihypertenseurs. Les patients ayant une bonne observance étaient plus susceptibles d’avoir au moins 50 ans (ORa = 2,625 ; IC à 95 % : 1,353 - 4,485 ; p = 0,014), d’avoir un niveau d’études supérieur (ORa = 7,797 ; IC à 95 % : 3,359 - 9,758 ; p = 0,009), d’appartenir à une classe socio- économique élevée (ORa = 2,546 ; IC à 95 % : 1,968 – 4,761 ; p &lt; 0,001) et de vivre avec l’hypertension depuis au moins cinq ans (ORa = 1,752 ; IC à 95 % : 1,367 - 7,456 ; p = 0,003).
L’observance des médicaments antihypertenseurs était globalement faible parmi les participants. Il est nécessaire que les prestataires de santé déploient des efforts concertés pour dépister régulièrement cette observance et fournir une éducation sanitaire qualitative visant à améliorer l’adhésion au traitement chez les patients hypertendus.

<h3 id="摘要-48">摘要</h3>
<p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk preventive interventions should be informed by and targeted at addressing health literacy needs of individuals and communities. This study assessed the CVD risk knowledge, perception, behaviours, and utilization of routine risk screening services among a Nigerian adult population.
A cross-sectional analytic study design was employed to assess the CVD risk knowledge, perception, behaviours, and utilization of risk screening services among a random multistage sample of 900 adults. Data were collected using an interviewer-administered semi-structured questionnaire adapted from the WHO STEPS questionnaire. Descriptive and inferential analyses of data collected were carried out using the IBM SPSS version 28 software.
The mean age of the study participants was 45.0 (SD = 18.7) years, with 66.8% reporting three concurrent risk behaviours, and 34.2% reporting utilization of at least one CVD risk screening service in the preceding year. Overall good CVD risk knowledge, and perception among the study participants was 77.2% and 19.6% respectively. Education, urban settlement, family history of CVD, good overall CVD risk knowledge and perception were predictors of the utilization of CVD risk screening services.
A significant proportion of the study participants reported multiple CVD risk behaviours, had poor risk perception and utilization of risk screening services despite having a good overall CVD risk knowledge. There is need for concerted efforts by the relevant stakeholder in the State Ministry of Health to target the adult population in the study setting with health promotion information on CVD risk prevention and the benefits of early risk detection.
Les interventions de prévention des risques liés aux maladies cardiovasculaires (MCV) devraient être fondées sur les besoins en littératie en santé des individus et des communautés. Cette étude a évalué les connaissances, la perception, les comportements et l’utilisation des services de dépistage de routine des risques cardiovasculaires parmi une population adulte nigériane.
Une étude analytique transversale a été menée auprès d’un échantillon aléatoire et multistadial de 900 adultes, afin d’évaluer leurs connaissances, perceptions, comportements et recours aux services de dépistage des risques cardiovasculaires. Les données ont été recueillies à l’aide d’un questionnaire semi-structuré administré par entretien, adapté du questionnaire WHO STEPS. Les analyses descriptives et inférentielles ont été effectuées à l’aide du logiciel IBM SPSS version 28.
L’âge moyen des participants était de 45,0 ans (écart-type = 18,7). Environ 66,8 % ont déclaré cumuler trois comportements à risque, tandis que 34,2 % avaient eu recours à au moins un service de dépistage des MCV au cours de l’année précédente. Globalement, 77,2 % des participants avaient une bonne connaissance des risques liés aux MCV, mais seulement 19,6 % en avaient une bonne perception. Le niveau d’études, le lieu de résidence (urbain), les antécédents familiaux de MCV, ainsi qu’une bonne connaissance et perception des risques cardiovasculaires étaient des facteurs prédictifs de l’utilisation des services de dépistage.
Une proportion importante des participants présentait plusieurs comportements à risque, une faible perception des risques et une faible utilisation des services de dépistage, malgré un bon niveau de connaissances générales. Des efforts concertés sont nécessaires de la part des acteurs concernés du ministère de la Santé de l’État afin de cibler la population adulte avec des messages de promotion de la santé sur la prévention des risques cardiovasculaires et les avantages d’une détection précoce.

<h3 id="摘要-49">摘要</h3>
<p>The high volume of antibiotics used for companion animals, off-label use of human-registered antibiotics for veterinary purposes, and close human-animal interactions raises policy concerns related to antimicrobial resistance in companion animals. This study aimed to assess the volume and type of antibiotic usage in companion animals at veterinary teaching hospitals in Thailand. In 2018, we obtained a dataset of visits that occurred between 2015 and 2017 from eight selected veterinary teaching hospitals with a high caseload of companion animals. In total, we included 938,522 dogs and 242,342 cats in our study. Total antibiotic consumption was estimated, and antibiotic usage was standardized by calculating the amount of antibiotic consumed by weight per year (mg/kg/year). The top five antibiotics used include amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, enrofloxacin, cephalexin, doxycycline, and metronidazole, all of which are commonly used to treat bacterial and parasitic infections. Critically important antimicrobials for human medicine, such as amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and enrofloxacin, were among the most used. From 2015 to 2017, total antibiotic usage (kg) markedly decreased (i.e., by 57.0%), with a particularly notable reduction of 78.2% observed for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Moreover, veterinarians’ overall prescriptions of antibiotics registered for human use decreased by 16% over the same period. However, there was a notable increase in the use of injectable antibiotics registered for human use relative to oral forms. Furthermore, we observed a relatively high usage of third-generation cephalosporins, which may contribute to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance in companion animals. This study emphasizes the need to educate veterinarians and veterinary students on the rational use of antibiotics and highlights the importance of regular monitoring and surveillance of antibiotic use in companion animals.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-50">摘要</h3>
<p>Anemia during pregnancy is a significant global public health issue, associated with adverse outcomes for both the mother and the newborn. While the prevalence and impact of anemia in pregnancy have been well-documented in general populations, the burden and severity of anemia among pregnant refugee women particularly those residing in the West Nile region of Uganda, remain unknown. Our study aimed to determine the prevalence and severity of anemia in this specific population to address this critical knowledge gap.
Between 1st April and 30th June 2023, we conducted a cross-sectional study among pregnant women attending the antenatal care clinic at 3 health centers serving the refugee communities in Adjumani district, Uganda. Anemia in pregnancy was defined as a hemoglobin (Hb) level of &lt; 11.0 g/dl and microcytosis as a mean corpuscular volume of &lt; 76 fL. Multivariable logistic regression was done to assess for the independent predictors of anemia in pregnancy. Data were analyzed in Stata version 15.0.
We enrolled 304 participants. The mean age of the participants was 25.4 years with a standard deviation of 4.9 years. The prevalence of anemia was 52.6% (95% CI 46.9-58.4). Of these, 85 (28.0%) were classified as mild, 73 (24.1%) moderate, and 2 (0.7%) had severe anemia. The median Hb was 10.8g/dL (10.1-11.7). Forty-one (25.6%) of those with anemia had microcytosis. Having at least a secondary/tertiary education level (aOR: 1.51, 95%CI: 0.98-1.78, p &lt; 0.001), being single (aOR: 1.77, 95%CI: 1.53-1.93, p &lt; 0.001) and parity &gt;4 (aOR: 1.51, 95%CI: 0.98-1.78, p &lt; 0.001) were associated with higher odds of having anemia.
Anemia in pregnancy is prevalent among pregnant refugee women in the West Nile Region of Uganda. Our findings suggest the need for targeted interventions such as health education about the consequences of anemia, promotion of early antenatal care (ANC) attendance, and provision of iron and folate supplementation during pregnancy, to potentially reduce the burden of anemia in this vulnerable population.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-51">摘要</h3>
<p>The time-series Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (TSIR) model has been a standard tool for studying the non-linear dynamics of acute, immunizing infectious diseases. The standard assumption of the TSIR model, that vaccination is equivalent to a reduction in the recruitment of susceptible individuals, or the birth rate, can lead to a bias in the estimate of the reporting fraction and of the total incidence. We show that this bias increases with the level of vaccination due to a double counting of individuals who are infected prior to the age of vaccination. We present a simple correction for this bias by discounting the observed number of cases by the product of the number that occur prior to the average age of vaccination and the vaccination coverage during the initial susceptible reconstruction step of the TSIR model fitting. We generate a time series of measles cases using an age-structured SIR transmission model with vaccination after birth (at 9 months of age) and illustrate the bias with the standard TSIR fitting method. We then illustrate that our proposed correction eliminates the bias in the estimated reporting fraction and total incidence. We note further that this bias does not impact the estimates of the seasonality of transmission.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-52">摘要</h3>
<p>Infectious diseases in livestock have detrimental effects on the health of animals, the livelihood of farmers, and the meat industry. Understanding the specific pathways of disease spread and evaluating the effectiveness of surveillance measures is critical to preventing large outbreaks. Direct livestock transport, transport tours-where a single truck moves livestock between multiple farms in a single journey-and contacts that livestock have with their surrounding environment have been identified as drivers of disease dissemination. The objective of this study was to assess the role of these different pathways in the transmission of several swine pathogens and to evaluate the efficacy of surveillance strategies in identifying outbreaks. To achieve this, we built contact networks for these modes of disease transmission based on empirical data from the Swiss swine production sector. We developed a stochastic, susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) type, herd-based model to simulate the spread of multiple pathogens within farms and between farms along the networks. We parameterized the model for Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) virus, African Swine Fever (ASF) virus, and Actinobacillus pleuropneumonia (APP): three pathogens with distinct clinical patterns, modes of transmission, and contact transmission rates. The model provides insight into the contribution of different contact types to disease dispersion. Our findings highlight that direct truck transport and local spread are the main routes of between-farm transmission. In addition, we analyzed the ability of surveillance measures to detect outbreaks from these distinct pathogens spreading along the contact networks. Farmer-based surveillance programs were the only measures that consistently identified outbreaks of APP and PRRS, and they were able to identify ASF outbreaks almost 8 weeks or more before active slaughterhouse- and network-based surveillance. Our model outcomes give evidence of the prominent transmission pathways and surveillance measures, which could help establish programs to prevent the spread of swine infectious diseases.</p>

<h3 id="摘要-53">摘要</h3>
<p>Youth driving under the influence of cannabis (DUIC) is a growing public health concern. While brief smartphone interventions have shown promise in reducing substance use and alcohol-impaired driving among youth, their efficacy for DUIC remains limited. Using the six-step Intervention Mapping framework, we developed and tested High Alert, a digital smartphone intervention designed to reduce DUIC among high-risk Canadian youth. The intervention was previously tested in a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing High Alert to an active control (exposure to six DUIC infographics) and a passive control (no contact). This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of High Alert using Step 6 of the Intervention Mapping framework. Reporting on this evaluation serves as a practical guide for researchers utilizing Intervention Mapping, offering valuable insights into High Alert’s formative, process, outcome, and acceptability evaluations to enhance DUIC prevention efforts. Formative and acceptability evaluations revealed High Alert’s positive reception among youth, with most participants willing to engage with it and recommend it to their peers. The program received high ratings for content and delivery, surpassing the static infographics used in the active control. Outcome evaluations demonstrated preliminary efficacy in reducing DUIC behaviour, particularly driving after cannabis co-use, compared to the no-contact group. Process evaluations highlighted implementation challenges, including online study bot activity, recruitment barriers (e.g., participant skepticism, limited ad targeting options), high attrition rates, and low adherence. Findings highlight the importance of Step 6 in Intervention Mapping, emphasizing the need for transparent and rigorous evaluation to inform future interventions. Addressing recruitment and implementation challenges is essential for improving the scalability and effectiveness of interventions targeting high-risk behaviours such as DUIC and will inform High Alert’s future testing.</p>
